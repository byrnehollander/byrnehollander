title: Teaching a Rhizome How to Signify-- A Visual Ontology
---

# Introduction
In this essay I aim to demystify Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome as described in their 1980 book *A Thousand Plateaus*. I begin by summarizing what I consider the spirit of the rhizome project and how it has been applied as a ’tool.’ I explore what it means to think rhizomatically, why one would do so, and its position as either metaphor or literal. I then challenge the definitions of a rhizome and assumptions the authors make to argue that a rhizome’s distinctions from the fascicular root are exaggerated. I employ DeLanda’s technical definitions of Deleuzean concepts to demystify the rhizome. I dwell on the subject of a-signfiying semiotics in order to understand the tangible utility of rhizomes (*clarify*). I continue with a discussion of graphs and visual knowledge. I posit that images can produce knowledge and that learning to read the meaning-producing argument structures of graphical forms implies signification. I further explore the notion of how diagrammatic images spatialize relations in a meaningful way and present Warren Sack’s conversation map and GUI as an early example of dynamic meaning production. I briefly discuss the idea of [semantic networks](http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/semantic_networks.htm) as rhizomatic.

I then consolidate these tools to argue how the Internet is rhizomatic. My main idea is if it is a rhizome, what does it mean? To quote Werner Herzog, “Does the Internet dream of itself?” I explore Ted Nelson’s notion of interwingularity and his vision of a hyper contextual Internet in order to provide a tangible example of how we might represent the interconnectedness of all things. I give examples of static visualizations of the Internet and the knowledge that can be gleaned from this visual representation, what is lost, and what can be gained from other methods.

I continue with a discussion of dimensionality reduction. I challenge D&G’s notion that all is lost in such a reduction and then consider various methods for achieving reduction. I briefly note the politics of data and reduction. I consider deep learning methods as a way of continually showing change where information from previous generations informs the next one. 

Finally, I consider the notion that ATP itself is a rhizome. I consider how its status as closed system interacts with the open system that is its connections— how the dimensions of time and space manipulate their meanings. With the examples of the internet and ATP now fleshed out, I consider the prospect of creating protocols that generalize knowledge and signify both visually and textually. I conclude with a list of references and provide source material when possible (definitely a breach of copyright law - can see them all [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sqcp8cy6wyqpcjh/AADNMp_5haQBLpWzk025u-k0a?dl=0)). 


# The Rhizome as Image of Nomad Thought
Structure seems to be the overarching theme of *A Thousand Plateaus*. It is a book rife with geological and botanical metaphors, a book that seeks to explain how space and relations within this space works. It is a book of constant motion and instability. It is a book they claim is a rhizome with 'plateaus' in place of chapters. "Each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau." (22) Further, their rhizome "has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle (*milieu*) from which it grows and which it overspills". (21) While they admit "it's not easy to see things in the middle, rather than looking down on them from above or up at them from below, or from left to right or right to left". Rhizomatic writing is not written from a sedentary view: they assemble heterogeneity and lack a fundamental unity. Thus, the question of where to begin seems strikingly lacking for nomadic writing. What can be our foundation if we begin *in media res*?

Perhaps the start is never the beginning-- how can we tackle the issue of presuppositions? In *Difference and Repetition*, Deleuze argues that most of philosophy was founded on the notion of common sense as *cogitatio natura universalis* (good will of the thinker and good nature of thought). He calls this thinking the 'pre-philosophical image of thought' because it fails to question the nature of thought and being. This particular image of thought implies that "thought has an affinity with the true; it formally possesses the true and materially wants the true. It is in terms of this image that everybody knows and is presumed to know what it means to think." This Image, according to Deleuze, "prejudges everything" and thus can be called a "dogmatic, orthodox or moral image". In questioning the absoluteness of morality, Deleuze concludes that the conditions of a philosophy which would be without any kind of presuppositions are such: instead of being supported by the moral Image of thought, it would take as its point of departure a radical critique of this Image and the 'postulates' it implies. It would find its difference or its true beginning, not in an agreement with the pre-philosophical Image but in a rigorous struggle against this Image, which it would denounce as non-philosophical. As a result, it would discover its authentic repetition in a thought without Image." (page 131)

Twelve years later, however, it appears that thought *can* have an image that is not pre-philosophical. And it is the notion that philosophy begins with the rhizome.

While it appears that the rhizome is our beginning, I must set the stage with a discussion of botany. As Christy Wampole illustrates in *Rootedness*, botanical metaphors--especially those of the tree and root--have long been used to efficiently say what is otherwise extremely difficult or even impossible to communicate. Further motivating the importance of botanical terminology, Wapole notes critical theory's reintroduction of the idea that "thought itself is botanical in nature and that humans should look toward plants as a model for dwelling in the world, because they provide an alternate paradigm for the treatment of space, time, consumption, and death." {% sidenote side1 Wampole, [*Rootedness*](#wampole), 4-5. %}

I now, as Deleuze and Guattari do in the introduction to *A Thousand Plateaus* describe the three major botanical figures: the Tree, the Root, and the Rhizome

## The Tree

I note that D&G assert that their rhizome is no metaphor.


Thus, I get to the crux of my argument. The concept of the rhizome has a basis for claiming it is not metaphorical, but what do these assumptions mean? How does it really differ from a root and how can we visualize it?


Thus, it is here where we must start. 


If we are to consider the notion that the "concept of the rhizome represents the literal translation of the... image of thought into modern philosophy" 
an image of thought that takes the form of a vast and intricate herbal (as Proust says)

In botany, a **rhizome** is a horizontal underground plant stem capable of producing the shoot and root systems of a new plant. Below is an illustration of the network structure that enables mushrooms to absorb nutrients from their environment.

Deleuze and Guattari begin *A Thousand Plateaus* with an appeal to the rhizome as an image of thought. The tyranny

Rather than 


it represents an externalization of the machinic dimension of Deleuze and Guattari’s philosophy, a machine that literally presents us with the following situation: Contemporary philosophy is an assemblage that presupposes a new image of thought on the plane of immanence." {% sidenote side2 Lambert, [*In Search of a New Image of Thought*](#lambert), 45. %}


is a concept to understand the image of thought. Shatter linearity - More total for being fragmented
Intention is to shatter "the linear unity of knowledge", stating that "this time, the principal root has aborted, or its tip has been destroyed: an immediate, indefinite multiplicity of secondary roots grats unto it and undergoes aflourishing development (6). Replacing "root-cosmos" with "radicle-chaosmos" provide radical critical perspectives on recent semantic visions to be realized by means of computational ontologies, which fuel the Semantic Web vision.

the concept of the rhizome, a "style of thought" (Goodchild, 1996: 85) introduced by Deleuze and Guattari in the opening passage of A Thousand Plateaus (1987).1  To oversimplify, the rhizome functions through lateral proliferation rather than tree-like vertical extension.  It was offered as an alternative to the constricting tree structure and dualism dominant in what Deleuze and Guattari call "state philosophy" (Massumi, 1987a: xi):

Closed upon itself, and holding the lid down on its own discipline, philosophy has often mistaken vacuity and ineptness for wisdom and rigor and the foul odors of inbreeding for signs of intellectual and moral integrity.  To open the lid, so that a gust of fresh air may come in from the outside, is not to waste time deciphering the signs of an upcoming end of philosophy.  (Boundas, 1993: 1)

     It is important not to see the rhizome in binary opposition to the tree, as Boundas seems to suggest by the title of his chapter "Rhizome Versus Trees" (1993: 27).2  Deleuze and Guattari themselves caution that "the root-tree and canal-rhizome are not two opposed models" (20).3  The concept of the rhizome was set up precisely to challenge dichotomous branching; yet by placing rhizome against tree, how can we ignore the self-contradictory dualism?  How do Deleuze and Guattari propose to get their rocket — or line of flight, as it were — off the ground?  They call forth

[t]he problem of writing: in order to designate something exactly, anexact [sic] expressions are utterly unavoidable.  ...  We invoke one dualism only in order to challenge another.  We employ a dualism of models only in order to arrive at a process that challenges all models.  (20)

This is more than an instance of rhetorical "stuttering" through which Deleuze is known to arrive at fresh philosophical concepts (Boundas, 1993: 1); for due to the "multiple entryways" of the rhizome, it is possible to enter the rhizome through a tree-dualism, "assuming the necessary precautions are taken", including, paradoxically, an avoidance of "Manichaean dualism" (14).  The relation of the rhizome to the tree is not one of dualism but of territorialization, but we shall return to this following a description of the six principles of the rhizome itself.



The six principles of the rhizome as listed by Deleuze and Guattari are as follows:

• connection 
• heterogeneity 
• multiplicity 
• asignifying rupture 
• cartography 
• decalcomania 

Goodchild reminds us that "these principles do not remain separate but mix with each other and proliferate" (1996: 85).  In other words, we should bear in mind that they do not function in isolation, but only together as a rhizome.  The rhizomatic method would ideally involve negotiating through all of these principles simultaneously so that they can proliferate in the reader's mind; but for reasons mentioned in the Introduction, the paper version of this thesis will stay with the linear mode of explication, while the HTML version will enable a nonlinear negotiation by the reader.  Rather than detail the principles and then say how they exist in the case of the Net, I will map each principle to the Net as I go along, in the hope of encouraging a form of proliferative mapping.




"What kind of image is to be deduced from thought? How can thinking be determined by the image, and where does image first acquire its power over thought—that is, to induce what is called "thinking" to occur within the subject? Following the thesis offered in chapter 1, I would argue that concept of the rhizome represents the literal translation of the Proustian image of thought into modern philosophy, an image of thought that takes the form of a vast and intricate herbal (as Proust says). More importantly, it represents an externalization of the machinic dimension of Deleuze and Guattari’s philosophy, a machine that literally presents us with the following situation: Contemporary philosophy is an assemblage that presupposes a new image of thought on the plane of immanence."

But say, my brothers, what can the child do that even the lion could not do? Why must the preying lion still become a child? The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel, a first movement, a sacred "Yes." For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred "Yes" is needed: the spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers the world.

Each rectangle is a vector and arrows represent functions (e.g. matrix multiply). Input vectors are in red, output vectors are in blue and green vectors hold the RNN's state (more on this soon). From left to right: **(1)** Vanilla mode of processing without RNN, from fixed-sized input to fixed-sized output (e.g. image classification). **(2)** Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words). **(3)** Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment). **(4)** Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French). **(5)** Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video). Notice that in every case are no pre-specified constraints on the lengths sequences because the recurrent transformation (green) is fixed and can be applied as many times as we like.
