# Introduction
[In this project I aim to demystify Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s [rhizome](#rhizome-as-mystical-or-metaphor) as described in their 1980 book <a href id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a>. I attempt to do so in a rather ambitious fashion--by applying their concept to this website as a whole; I treat this page as an assemblage to plug in seemingly disparate concepts. My primary goal is to provide a vision for what a hyperliteral rhizome *might* look like. D&#124;G insist their rhizome is not a [metaphor](#rhizome-as-mystical-or-metaphor) and simultaneously insist that any rhizome is too unstable to be represented, that “a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model” (<a href="" id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;">12</a>). I suppose this project was born from my frustration with this notion that there is no way to visualize {% marginnote margin2 %} 
However, don't feel obligated to engage with this post linearly. I hope readers find their own way through this page and its hyperlinks. In fact, here’s [where I think things really start to heat up](#bring-the-heat). After you could even go right to the [section titled “Intertwingularity”](#intertwingularity) (I didn't make this word up—-<a href="http://hyperland.com" target="_blank">the guy who coined ‘hypertext’</a> did. Unfortunately it didn’t catch on to the same degree). After that you could pop back in and finish the [introduction](#introduction)? In fact, I think this might be the part where I take a detour to explain just what it is I'm trying to do here. One additional motivator for hyperlinks is the fact that (hopefully) this post will be read by people with a range of philosophical backgrounds; this will let people find their own entry point, let people who already understand trees skip over that, or those who are curious about deep learning can explore that topic first.
{% endmarginnote %} this “[image of thought]( #the-rhizome-as-image-of-nomad-thought)”. My impulse was to consider dynamic, algorithmically generated graphs (with GUIs) as appropriate visualizations: the diagram would be in constant flux as new information enters the system *and* can be manipulated by users (e.g., filtering out certain information, zooming, etc.) However, this seems to be a poor starting point for this paper: I haven’t motivated the problem, set the stakes, or considered what it would mean for these diagrams to supposedly represent rhizomes. For instance Gregoriou argues "The goal is not to represent the rhizome but to implant it in thought. The effect they [Deleuze and Guattari] are after is not the understanding of the rhizome but a functioning, a whole apparatus that connects disparate, linguistic and non-linguistic things" (<a href id="gre" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01aGd0VTI4bE5HeHM','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;">“Commencing the Rhizome"</a> 240). Thus, I step back and propose a roadmap through which I hope to get to the crux of this problem. 

But before I do, I first provide a little guidance for navigating this page. It’s filled with hyperlinks{% sidenote side1 I’m particularly proud of the [bibliography](#bibliography) section (that is, its technical implementation)--anything that’s clickable opens a new window with the entire source document at your fingertips. A bunch of work went into this feature but I’ll spare you the technical details. I know I’m infringing copyright, but I implore you to suspend disbelief and imagine legality (and, for some, ethics) is not a concern here. I do it to prototype a digital rhizome. See <a href="#intertwingularity">intertwingularity</a></span> and you may have noticed that an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Annotate</code> button pops up anytime you highlight text. Consider them a recognition of the impossibility of creating a standalone work that explains a given concept once and for all. Plus, I want this page to be dynamic and to read people's comments. I don't think this instability implies any more chaos or disorganization than a typical academic paper. 
<!-- {% sidenote side2 For instance, would willful disorganization have a [table of contents](#table-of-contents)? %} -->
{% marginnote margin3 %} 
{% image http://i.imgur.com/lNkeZXX.gif 245 138 raw %}
{% endmarginnote %} Additionally, D&#124;G are of the same mind when it comes to any totalizing project:

{% blockquote Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, <a href id="anx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01QkEwNFFPQ3lwZHM','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Anti-Oedipus</em></a> (42) %}
We believe only in totalities that are peripheral. And if we discover such a totality alongside various separate parts, it is a whole of these particular parts but does not totalize them; it is a unity of all those particular parts but does not unify them; rather it is added to them as a new part fabricated separately.{% endblockquote %}

While I would rather not paraphrase Deleuze and Guattari, this one is worth keeping in mind: *when the sum of the parts become a whole, the whole itself becomes a part*. One metaphor might be assembling an infinite puzzle: while you can connect pieces to form largest units, there will always pieces left to connect

Which reminds me: while I have a [laundry list of references](#references) and [suggestions for further reading](#relevant-literature), this is not a rigorous academic paper. To be plain, *I am playing fast and loose*. I'm going for breadth rather than depth. I view D&#124;G's rhizome as a challenge; perhaps my lack of exhaustive analysis is not a cop out, but an application of rhizomatic thought? I don't buy it. I intend to explain myself and represent my ideas as clearly as possible (which is why I've chosen this format and selected so many visual aids). I would rather be ambitious and fail than limit my scope to something uninteresting and/or unimportant. Thus, I take advantages of abstractions wherever possible. If someone has already explained a concept clearer or more succinctly than I have, why reproduce it when I could merely point you in its direction? Through this lens one might argue that thinking rhizomatically (if this can be considered 'thinking rhizomatically') is an excuse for laziness. Maybe. But if I've already found what I consider to be the answer to a particular problem, why should I put it in different terms? I view myself as a compositor{% sidenote side3 See chapter 3 of <a href id="lev" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01VWJKYzAwbjltdjA','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;">*The Language of New Media*</a> for more on selection and compositing. %} more than anything. If I'm to contribute to scholarship in any meaningful way, it won't be for clever axioms, but for my ability to see how pieces {% marginnote margin4 %} 
Not only is this assignment's deadline ominously looming, but I have [another ambitious project](https://github.com/byrnehollander/connected) due the following day. Which brings me to the advice I generally try to follow: "Never half-ass two things. Full ass one thing."
{% endmarginnote %}
{% marginnote margin5 %} 
{% youtube zl-HalherjQ 600 400 raw %}
{% endmarginnote %} might fit together. I hope some interestingness comes of it. Moreover, this leads me to address a logistical issue: this project is primarily a submission for my English seminar. It could be best to consider this project as a kind of starting point for grappling with the rhizome. In some ways I am overtly essentialist and in other ways I am possibly mistaken. I've considered that this might not be *the best way* to discuss the rhizome, but it does seem like a novel approach. Further, it is dynamic and I can continue to refine it--it will not cease to exist for all intents and purposes once it is turned it (though I discuss the ephemerality of the web in [a later place](#this-post-as-a-rhizome)).

Further, the `Annotate` button is an implementation of <a href="http://genius.com/web-annotator" target="_blank">Genius's web annotator</a> which lets you "add line-by-line annotations to any page on the Internet".{% sidenote side4 While there are <a href="https://hypothes.is" target="_blank">other annotating solutions</a>, no other service has a `.js` embed. I'm a big fan of Genius and I hope you consider <a href="http://genius.com/signup" target="_blank">creating an account</a> and annotating something on this page.%}

Anyway, back to the roadmap.{% sidenote side5 That was longwinded. I hope some took my advice to navigate this page non-linearly. %} As I said, this project began with a deceptively simple (or misleading) question: "What would a rhizome *look* like?" I now try to view the concepts on their own level and understand what problems the rhizome looked to solve. In other words, I try to unravel the context from which the concept sprang. 

I [begin](#the-rhizome-as-image-of-nomad-thought) by trying to locate the genesis of the rhizome project. I [then argue](#structure) that it differs from the root in that it tries to be 'anti-Structure'. I explore what it means to think rhizomatically and consider the concept's position as either metaphor or literal map. I find a mystical quality in the definition of the rhizome. I consider in what ways the Internet is supposedly not rhizomatic and if the maps rhizomes produce have those same characteristics.

I briefly consider the [diagram](#diagrams-meaningfully-spatialize-relationships). I mainly provide examples of past diagrams and propose a basic outline for diagramming a rhizome. I mention Ted Nelson’s notion of [interwingularity](#intertwingularity) and his vision of a hypercontextual Internet to provide a model for how we might represent the interconnectedness of all things.

I continue with a brief discussion of methods for [collecting and classifying data](#simulating-and-classifying) that can be turned into maps of rhizomes. Next, I consider [D&#124;G's claim](#a-thousand-plateaus-as-a-rhizome) that <a href id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a> is itself a rhizome. I consider how its status as closed system interacts with the open system that is its connections. I then consider this [page itself as a rhizome](#this-post-as-a-rhizome). I [conclude](#conclusion) and provide a [bibliography](#bibliography). 


# The Rhizome as Image of Nomad Thought
Structure seems to be the overarching theme of <a href id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a>. It is a book rife with geological and botanical metaphors, a book that seeks to explain space and relations within this space. It is a book of constant motion and instability. It is a book they claim is a rhizome with 'plateaus' in place of chapters. "Each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau" (22). Further, their rhizome "has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle (*milieu*) from which it grows and which it overspills" (21). I note that the rhizome is borrowed from botany, where it is a horizontal underground plant stem capable of producing the shoot and root systems of a new plant. Below is an illustration of the network structure that enables mushrooms to absorb nutrients from their environment. {% marginnote margin8 %}

Further motivating the importance of botanical terminology, Wapole notes critical theory's reintroduction of the idea that "thought itself is botanical in nature and that humans should look toward plants as a model for dwelling in the world, because they provide an alternate paradigm for the treatment of space, time, consumption, and death." {% sidenote side1 Wampole, [*Rootedness*](#wampole), 4-5. %}

Rhizomatic writing is not written from a sedentary view: they assemble heterogeneity and do not seek fundamental unity. Thus, the question of where to begin seems strikingly lacking for nomadic writing. What can be our foundation if we begin *in media res*?
{% blockquote Gilles Deleuze, <a href id="drx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Difference and Repetition</em></a> (129) %}
Where to begin in philosophy has always--rightly--been regarded as a very delicate problem, for beginning means eliminating all presuppositions. However, whereas in science one is confronted by objective presuppositions which axiomatic rigour can eliminate, presuppositions in philosophy are as much subjective as objective.
{% endblockquote %}
Yet, it is by confronting this important problem that Deleuze understands that there is no simple answer.{% sidenote side1 **Reading suggestion**: <a href id="drx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Difference and Repetition</em></a>'s Chapter III - The Image of Thought (though I cover some of it here) %}

Perhaps the start can never be the beginning-- how can we tackle the issue of presuppositions? In <a href id="dar" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01YVBwdWh0NXFIaWc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Difference and Repetition</em></a>, Deleuze argues that most of philosophy was founded on the notion of common sense as *cogitatio natura universalis* (good will of the thinker and good nature of thought). He calls this thinking the 'pre-philosophical image of thought' because it fails to question the nature of thought and being. This particular image of thought implies that "thought has an affinity with the true; it formally possesses the true and materially wants the true. It is in terms of this image that everybody knows and is presumed to know what it means to think." This Image, according to Deleuze, "prejudges everything" and thus can be called a "dogmatic, orthodox or moral image". In questioning the absoluteness of morality, Deleuze concludes that the conditions of a philosophy which would be without any kind of presuppositions are such: instead of being supported by the moral Image of thought, it would take as its point of departure a radical critique of this Image and the 'postulates' it implies. It would find its difference or its true beginning, not in an agreement with the pre-philosophical Image but in a rigorous struggle against this Image, which it would denounce as non-philosophical. As a result, it would discover its authentic repetition in a thought without Image" (131).

<a id="structure"></a>The ultimate distinction Deleuze finds between nonphilosophy and philosophy is that true philosophy lacks a foundation from which to build-- there is neither truth in human nature nor in the world. Likewise, Derrida's trace is rejected for having a 'Structure'-- as radical as it may be, Deleuze argues it still has meaning because it traces a preexisting structure or genealogical inheritance. While Wampole claims that "the rhizome is not radically different from the root. It is still an embedded form, its pace of growth is the same, and it represents yet another instance of thinking botanically about thought” (223), she doesn't take this idea of structure particularly seriously. To her it is simply a nonbinary, nonhierarchical epistemology. She says that its lack of structure means its “thinking takes place in the ground” (223).

{% endmarginnote %}

I think the important take away is that a graph of the root is iterating towards theoretically realizable edges (i.e., connections between concepts). Still it is a meaning not stable enough to subsist off. Likewise, it is not clear that concepts of different kinds can be on the same graph. Important to understand that the rhizome first signaled a break between Deleuze and Barthes / Derrida who believed in the "process of rewriting, reweaving, and grafting of all of the fragments and missing parts in a “Total Work or Magnum Opus”{% sidenote side2 Lambert, [*In Search of a New Image of Thought*](#lambert), 52. %}. In other words, Barthes and Derrida's philosophies imply that we are constantly in the process of delaying a totalizing image (at least while consciousness is out there). Still, it is about the structure of the world and what we are based off.

Still, D&#124;G's rhizome provides an ontology of relationships: everything is connected to everything else no matter how different they seem to be. I now make the trivial argument that some things can be more strongly connected than others. Take two slightly different sequences of DNA that end up expressing the same gene. They are more strongly connected (assuming that strength of connection is correlated with similarity) to each other than either sequence to any painting. Still, they are on the same graph.

Which brings me back to my initial question: **How do you connect (i.e. create a map of) that which has no definitions between elements?** I believe D&#124;G respond: we don't; the universe does. They tell us: "**There exists a map, that much is for sure. Everything is on the map. Everything is connected.**" Yet they claim we cannot manifest its structure. Before I go any further, I must motivate the notion that it deeply matters if we believe this statement. Further, the statement has different meanings depending on if we conceive of the rhizome as metaphor or literally. In the next section, I consider the implications of each position and relate them back to the Internet.

## Rhizome as mystical or metaphor
Some critics have argued that <a href id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a> should be recognized more for its poetics than for its philosophy: "by replacing argument with a flurry of pictures, [D&#124;G] imagine they’ll change minds, since the human is such a visual creature. We no longer choose and commit to one picture; we accumulate and shuffle them" (Wapole 222). Wapole continues by arguing that this lack of argument implies a penchant for mysticism, which I hinted at in the previous paragraph. As a metaphor, this concept celebrates multiplicity and the dissolution of hierarchy and categories, and the horizontal proliferation of all aspects of life. These characteristics fundamentally influence how one experiences the world. I argue that the rhizome that is an "image of thought" is a metaphorical rhizome. Lambert seems to agree: "Deleuze and Guattari's rhizomatic experiment might be judged today as a failure, given that it was perceived as too abstract and appeared to convince no one, particularly not philosophers themselves" (60). 

If we choose to literalize this concept, we must grapple with how this concept is *actually created*. D&#124;G themselves didn't want the rhizome to be treated as a metaphor. Gregoriou explains that the rhizome must be rescued from its "literary over-coding in a pedagogical discourse as a metaphor for excessive multiplicity and radical openness. *The rhizome must be made*" (246). I agree wholeheartedly that the rhizome must be made.

When you hyperliteralize the rhizome, you lose all metaphor (of a certain kind) in exchange for a different kind of abstraction. We can now think what it might take to define the structure for such a map. In <a href id="gap" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01ZDhEeUNOdXlqNWs','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Protocol</em></a>, Galloway argues that one major quality that disqualifies the Internet from being a rhizome is its protocol, i.e., that parts of the networks have designed systems for connecting and interacting with each other. 

{% blockquote Thacker, Eugene. <a href id="gap" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01ZDhEeUNOdXlqNWs','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Foreword to Protocol</em></a> (xiii) %}
[Networks] are material technologies, sites of variable practices, actions, and movements. This is, perhaps, stated too strongly. Yes, metaphors do materialize and corporealize, and, in some sense, metaphor is consonant with language itself. But discussions of networks—-especially in cultural theory-—have too often slipped into “vapor theory,” eliding a specific consideration of the material substrate and infrastructure with a general discussion of links, webs, and globalized connectivity.
{% endblockquote %}

The infrastructure is of the highest importance here. Once we have protocols, a true map from content to content is created. We must additionally create a scheme for placing value on the edges between nodes and then do something interesting with this graph, but protocols must be the first step. 
{% blockquote Galloway, Alexander. <a href id="gap" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01ZDhEeUNOdXlqNWs','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Protocol</em></a> (52) %}
Protocols do not perform any interpretation themselves; that is, they encapsulate information inside various wrappers, while remaining relatively indifferent to the content of information contained within. The consequences of this are legion. It means that protocological analysis must focus not on the sciences of meaning (representation/interpretation/ reading), but rather on the sciences of possibility (physics or logic).
{% endblockquote %}

{% sidenote side11 I think my project really heats up right around here. %}By positing the existence of a literal rhizome (and thus a map), D&#124;G implicitly argue that a protocol exists for adding *anything* to the graph and a function exists to evaluate the relationship between *anything* and *anything else*. While they insist that "[u]nlike a structure, which is defined by a set of points and positions, with binary relations between the points and biunivocal relationships between the positions, the rhizome is made only of lines: lines of segmentarity and stratification as its dimensions, and the line of flight or deterritorialization as the maximum dimension after which the multiplicity undergoes metamorphosis, changes in nature" and that "[t]hese lines, or lineaments, should not be confused with lineages of the arborescent type, which are merely localizable linkages between points and positions," the six characteristics they use to define a rhizome do not support all of their assertions (22). They say everything is connected, though by lines and not lineages. But really, this definition of a rhizome is meaningless in my pursuit of visualizing a rhizome: they've already said every "rhizome pertains to a map that must be produced, constructed" (21). If every rhizome must have a corresponding graph, I will focus my energy there as graphs are an undeniably more stable concept than that of the rhizome. Graph terminology I will use from here on out:

- Every node *`x`* is anything that could be in a conceivable rhizome *`r`*.
- Every node *`y`* is anything that could be in *`r`* and is not *`x`* (no duplicates in the rhizome).
- I call an *edge* anything that links `node` *`x`* to `node` *`y`* in *`r`*.
- Edge *`weight`* refers to the strength of a connection (in `units`). 
- Each edge's *`weight`* is calculated by executing function *f* on the `start` and `goal` nodes ("`weight_xy` = *f* (*`x`*, *`y`*)")
- There is also a function *fp* that calculates the *`cost`* of traversing `path` *`p`* to get from `start` to `goal` (cost_xyp = *fp* (*`x`*, *`y`*, *`p`*))
  - This function exists so we can cluster nodes with strong connections.
- All my edges are directed (i.e., the edge from *`x`* to *`y`* might not have the weight as the edge from *`y`* to *`x`*).
- A 'line of flight' is a vector or sequence of vectors that make the edge weights of a rhizome unstable

While such a rhizome *`r`* must exist if we are to literalize the concept itself, we lack the protcol to create nodes and assign edge weights and path costs. Nevertheless, a protcol and algorithm must exist such that the *`r`* is constructed. The notion that a new rhizome is 


In spite of the heterogeneity of the nodes, each is generic enough to be comparable or they could not exist on the same assemblage. This seems tautological: if there is a mapping and they are connected, there must exist a method to compute connection or else they would not be connected. I think D&#124;G might agree with this, but perhaps mystify it by saying they are in constant motion and unstable so any connection is temporary or that they are connected by a function, but that function is unknowable. Makes me think of computability theory. But if it were not computable, how could relationships as such exist? (randomness and not computable - Chaitin's constant) Further, there is a map. The universe's algorithm *always* returns an answer.
Further, it neglects heterogeneity by placing everything on the same level. While it does show that everything is on the same assemblage, it is a poor figure for representing a break from the root which was (I think) more homogeneous. 

I now argue that protcol, a scheme for linking content, and analysis of the resulting diagram must exist for all digital information.

Per graph theory, we can convert horizontal movements (lines of flight) into nodes (semiotic chains) and vertices. So far, the rhizome image is holding up. But then we get this idea that every node is connected to every other node. This is unclear-- is there a direct connection between each node or is it simply that there exists a path from *x* to *y*? I'll give D&#124;G the benefit of the doubt and presume they mean the latter. (“any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be.” it's ambiguous. actually doesn't matter which method. if there's a path through connection, value of that path can be the edge weight between vertex *x* and *y*. Still, it is easier to represent the relationships if we have paths rather than weighted graphs.) Still, how do we compare a strand of DNA to a painting? They would need to share some attributes, or for there to be a path that has enough attributes in common. 

This is exactly how Galloway argues the Internet is not rhizomatic-- the universal algorithm that creates relations between nodes is protcol. 



He argues that a consistent connection between parts of the network is important. But this consisntency is itself asignifying



Still, the rhizome is frequently treated metaphorically. It is less about what the map looks like but what is supposedly in it. In fact, the map is totally non-traditional: it is "composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion". And further defined as certainly *not* a trace. 

I now argue that rhizomes only lack protocol on the metaphorical level. 

Thought and being

simultaneously units and wholes from bits to databases

continuum

hierarchical, categorizable and sequential

In an important sense there are no "subjects" at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly

Thus, we must create a protocol to describe connections in a rhizome. If we fail to compare artifacts of the same medium (e.g., text, picture, video), we never stood a chance. If we manage this, we need to compare across mediums. Therefore, just one heuristic function must be responsible for connecting picture *x* to picture *y*, picture *y* to picture *x*,  If there is no underlying truth and everything is in chaos, impossible. But we can create heuristics for defining similarity. None are absolutely verifiably true, but what is this notion that everything is mystically connected and there is no total? Always moving and with no total, but we define connections. This is an idea of pagerank and using hypertext to mark relationships between html pages. But the pages themselves have concepts- how do we separate them out? Thus, we have a gradient. In continuous space, we don't need to specify who is closest, but everything's relationship to everything else. 

In other words, the rhizome suggests the “subterranean” presence of connections; but theories of systems and emergent phenomena provide a more explicitly technological model to describe how these connections can be established, actualized, and experienced - this is the mystical?

We have the tools to generate new concepts - monkey and typewriters except their typewriters only have suggested phrases that they select at random. This is the infinite deferral of totalization. What if the goal is not to totalize what will be, but to show the current state of things? Context. Somewhat reminds me of the impossibility of proving the lack of free will through simulation because not enough atoms in the universe. 

But that isn't enough to separate the ideas about structure and heterogeneity. “A rhizome ceaselessly establishes connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.” There is no proper territory, and moreover, no proper language. Signs of art can be placed in conjunction with signs of politics or organizations of power.

So every rhizome is a map is a network. We just don't know the protocol. (Yes, under this new definition of rhizome, the Internet fulfills all the qualifications. I discuss possible diagrams for the Internet below.)


What Deleuze and Guattari call the principles of cartography and decalcomania repeats the argument of the notion of a plane of consistency that is not amenable to any structural or generative model
- BUT maps can be genealogical. In one generation, we can add, remove, or reweight vertices. The context has changed so the concept has too is their likely argument. While everything might have reprocussions on everything else (and does, according to them), that doesn't mean they are fundamentally uncomparable between generations. If everything exists on a continuum, why can't things merely shift rather than be destroyed. Still doesn't find the meaning, but creates it


1987 definition of a rhizome
The rhizome multiple must be made ... a rhizome as subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radicles. Bulbs and tubers are rhizomes. . . Rats are rhizomes.
Burrows are too, in all of their functions of shelters, supply,
movement, evasion, and breakout. The rhizome itself assumes
very diverse forms, from ramified surface extension in all directions to concretion into bulbs and tubers. When rats
swarm over each other. The rhizome includes the best and the
worst: potato and couchgrass, or the weed. (

Freeing thought to let it become vital

Not either tree or pure rhizome fin: a becoming of pedagogies

<!-- I now, as Deleuze and Guattari do in the introduction to *A Thousand Plateaus* describe the three major botanical figures: the [Tree](#the-tree), [the Root](#the-radicle-system-or-fascicular-root), and the [Rhizome](#the-rhizome). But before I do, want a brief aside about the metaphor. -->


Wampole 227: “the rhizome’s vegetal matter does not last long enough to tell a tale and its surface is not dense enough to be inscribed with any lasting message. Any inscription on the rhizome would decompose along with it”
- How generations preemptively mark generations to come
- Very much in process but you can see what’s going on while processing is perpetually going on behind the scenes
- Could argue that I’m taking the forms too literally, but if they really are not metaphors, how else is one to take them?

Seeking the truth but unwittingly obfuscating through an endless series of speculative gesture. What truth can we find in n-dimensional reduction?

Rather than root on paper, expand it into a four-dimensional phenomenon, plastic and dynamic in time and space
- Paradoxical to capture a line of flight; the moment as multiple things pass into one each other at varying degrees

Wampole 231: rhizome still has “points of interest”, with lines intersecting to form meaningful junctions
- Is this not radical enough? How radical and abstract can we make the idea while it still being a useful tool? Does it matter if it's a useful tool?
- Building blocks of the rhizome described as molecules, atoms, particles, genes, and other microscopic units

Lines of flight describe the volatile vectors of the rhizome (page 232)
- Stochastic modelling? Chaos? Spurns stability and formal predictability

“Favoring production over reproduction, ‘a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model’ (12)” (233)
- Dichotomy between production and reproduction; can’t we have it both ways?

Becoming > Being
- If always passing from multiple becomings to multiple becomings, at what point do we simply call them beings?

Cynical French physicists in *Fashionable nonsense* call it a result of longstanding abuse of scientic jargon:
“one sees that there is a great concentration of scientific terms, employed out of context and without any apparent logic, at least if one attributes to these terms their usual scientific meanings. To be sure, Deleuze and Guattari are free to use these terms in other senses: science has no monopoly on the use of words like “chaos”, “limit” or “energy”. But, as we shall show, their writings are crammed also with highly technical terms that are not used outside of specialized scientific discourses, and for which they provide no alternative definition.
These texts touch on a great variety of subjects: Gödel’s theorem, the theory of transfinite cardinals, Riemannian geometry, quantum mechanics …198 But the allusions are so brief and superficial that a reader who is not already an expert in these subjects will be unable to learn anything concrete. And a specialist reader will find their statements most often meaningless, or sometimes acceptable but banal and confused.
We are well aware that Deleuze and Guattari’s subject is philosophy, not the popularization of science. But what philosophical function can be fulfilled by this avalanche of ill-digested scientific (and pseudo-scientific) jargon? In our opinion, the most plausible explanation is that these authors possess a vast but very superficial erudition, which they put on display in their writings.”




“What are some common metaphoric uses of networks that Protocol resists? One is that networks are synonymous with connectivity (and that connectivity is always good). Tropes of links, nets, webs, and a general relationality also stem from this use of networks. Pop science writing on network science or the gee-whiz rhetoric of magazines such as Wired often adopt a quantitative politics: If information wants to be free, then more connectivity equals more freedom.”
“But the concept of “protocol” is as concerned with disconnection as it is with connectivity. The moment of disconnectivity is the moment when protocol most forcefully displays its political character. Disconnectivity can occur in a number of ways, from a personal dialup disconnected due to a time limit imposed by a commercial ISP, to the management (or surveillance) of large-scale networks involved in political activism. The analysis in part III below of hacking, computer viruses, and the tactical appropriation of both by cyberfeminism provides a set of examples for how disconnectivity can be as instrumental for protocol’s (mal)functioning as is connectivity.”

Do the politics of this disconnectivity affect the Bhopal community itself? Do policies regarding information content (DMCA) actually encourage such regulation? These are complex questions which have arisen from this event, one that has been made possible by the dual nature of the Internet that Protocol points to: its horizontality (community networks; TCP/IP) and its verticality (its stratification; DNS).

Rhizome as a style of thought
To oversimplify, the rhizome functions through lateral proliferation rather than tree-like vertical extension.

Deleuze and Guattari themselves caution that "the root-tree and canal-rhizome are not two opposed models" (20).  The concept of the rhizome was set up precisely to challenge dichotomous branching; yet by placing rhizome against tree, how can we ignore the self-contradictory dualism? 


[t]he problem of writing: in order to designate something exactly, anexact [sic] expressions are utterly unavoidable. We invoke one dualism only in order to challenge another.  We employ a dualism of models only in order to arrive at a process that challenges all models.  (20)

This new cybernetic process will rely on our exponential increase in computational power to process and  lter the massive data required to provide a real-time documentation of global activity and resulting behavioral patterns. Each element within our collective biosphere will need to be carefully tracked, interrelating multiple factors such as geologic and climatic conditions, predatory traits, and life cycles. In this complex and multidimensional data environment, the role of visualization will be key in pro- viding the capacity to recognize the emergent patterns and processes of these phenomena. Visualization will itself become organic, as it will need to adapt to simu- late information from a wide spectrum of sources, ranging from micro/organic to macro/planetary states. The role of arti cial intelligence will be critical in creating this new cybernetic form of resistance, revealing abnormal trends and anomalies and giving us the ability to utilize resources

Wampole 252 “To specialize is to decontextualize”  Specialization is in response to the simple fact that the world and what is knowable have become too big for the brain to handle. We favor a more manageable smallness over unwieldy largeness and thus break civilization down into composites. By focusing on what is immediate and summarizable, we forfeit our own context. Without context meaning breaks down

"what are maps for? This is simple enough to answer: to find one’s direction, to orient movement toward something. "

Ultimately, it seems that the distinction between trace and rhizome is that a trace is sometimes amenable

 “The tracing has already translated the map into an image; it has already transformed the rhizome into roots and radicals.”20 Here we can see the precise problem: the book machine as root system and the radical system as infinite textuality always return to extinguish the possible creation of the rhizome. They return again to reproduce hierarchies, or to dissipate the lateral movement of connections in a sterile form of a Structure

Network-as-diagram based on the Deluzean concept of diagram; “Protocol considers networks through a “diagram,” a term borrowed from Gilles Deleuze. Protocol considers first a network as a set of nodes and edges, dots and lines. The dots may be computers (server, client, or both), human users, communities, LANs, corporations, even countries. The lines can be any practice, action, or event effectuated by the dots (downloading, emailing, connecting, encrypting, buying, logging on, port scanning). With this basic “diagram” you can do a number of things. You can connect the dots—all of them—making a totally connected, distributed network with more than one path to the destination. You can also disconnect dots, even delete dots (no paths, no destination). You can filter out which dots are connected to the network. You can create portals for the addition of future dots. You can designate which kinds of lines you want between the dots (for not all lines are equal; some diverge, flee; others converge, coalesce). In short, a network-as-diagram offers all sorts of possibilities for organization, regulation, and management.”

# How the Internet is rhizomatic

toy example of the internet
or a page on the internet

can limit it to things that interact with it - people linking to it or things it links to changing
the outside changing its context

So to equate the Web with the rhizome, one must argue against those who describe the Web as a free, structureless network, and argue for a certain kind of rhizomatic protocol on the Web. This is a discussion already underway in chapter 1 and in the introduction.


Indeed, the Internet works too well. If the Internet were truly rhizomatic, it would resist identification. It would resist the deep, meaningful uses that people make of it everyday. The Net is not narrative-based, or time-based. But it still enthralls users, dragging them in, as television and cinema did before it. How? The answer is in the form.

- 
- to resist identification - how is resisting meaningful uses relate to its idea of not being a metaphor?


Internet is in part compelling because of its continuity - its ability to use the application layer to create a compelling, intuitive experience for the user
- thus, must likewise create continuity within a deep learning network
Galloway differentiates the Internet from the rhizome: “the Web is structured around rigid protocols that govern the transfer and representation of texts and images—so the Web isn’t “an acentered, nonhierarchical, nonsignifying system” as is Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome” (61-2). I don’t think the Web’s protocols mean it is acentered or hierarchical (it’s still decentralized), but the nonsignifying aspect does seem to be the key differentiator. However, if we concede that a rhizome can in fact signify, I don’t see why we cannot physically represent a rhizome.
lines can be turned into nodes where a node is a semiotic chain

connectedness - unclear if graph theory meaning or means that there is a direct connection (i.e., vertex between each node); Galloway’s depiction of a distributed network on page 35 makes me think it’s the former and that X can reach Y (and vice versa) through several paths 

Protocol-
Founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language, code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary analysis as any natural language; computer languages have their own syntax, grammar, communities, and cultures.

Galloway argues that such protocols are the way that control is exercised in our globalized “network society,” one where power is “distributed” laterally, rather than being hierarchically structured, stratified, and centralized, or even (merely) “decentralized.” A distributed network is a rhizome rather than a tree 
Centralized- single host by which radial nodes are attached
A network can also have multiple hosts, each with its own set of satellite nodes

The Net is not narrative-based, or time-based. But it still enthralls users, dragging them in, as television and cinema did before it. How? The answer is in the form.
One concept that I will borrow from film theory is continuity. Despite being a decentralized network composed of many different data fragments, the Internet is able to use the application layer to create a compelling, intuitive experience for the user. This is the secret of continuity.

Why does being rhizomatic inherently mean that it resists identification; derived by their definition, right? same with no “organizing memory or central automation”

interface of representation - how do  interact?

how much do representations of the world change when new things happen?

no perfect representation of thought; only models. how good will they be? I don't know.

Each rectangle is a vector and arrows represent functions (e.g. matrix multiply). Input vectors are in red, output vectors are in blue and green vectors hold the RNN's state (more on this soon). From left to right: **(1)** Vanilla mode of processing without RNN, from fixed-sized input to fixed-sized output (e.g. image classification). **(2)** Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words). **(3)** Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment). **(4)** Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French). **(5)** Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video). Notice that in every case are no pre-specified constraints on the lengths sequences because the recurrent transformation (green) is fixed and can be applied as many times as we like.
