# Introduction
In this project I aim to demystify Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s [rhizome](#rhizome-as-nystical-or-metaphor) as described in their 1980 book <a href id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a>. I attempt to do so in a rather ambitious fashion--by applying their concept to this website as a whole. I treat this page as an assemblage I use to plug in seemingly disparate concepts. My main goal, perhaps, is to provide a vision for what a hyperliteral rhizome *might* look like. D&G insist their rhizome is not a [metaphor](#the-metaphor) and simultaneously insist that any rhizome is too unstable to be represented, that “a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model” (12). I suppose this project was born from my frustration with this notion that there is no way to visualize {% marginnote margin2 %} 
However, don't feel obligated to engage with this post linearly. I hope readers find their own way through this page and its hyperlinks. In fact, here’s a [link to the first section about diagrams](#diagrams-meaningfully-spatialize-relationships). After you could even go right to the [section titled “Intertwingularity”](#intertwingularity) (I didn't make this word up—-<a href="http://hyperland.com" target="_blank">the guy who coined ‘hypertext’</a> did. Unfortunately it didn’t catch on to the same degree). After that you could pop back in and finish the [introduction](#introduction)? In fact, I think this might be the part where I take a detour to explain just what it is I'm trying to do here. One additional motivator for hyperlinks is the fact that (hopefully) this post will be read by people with a range of philosophical backgrounds; this will let people find their own entry point, let people who already understand trees skip over that, or those who are curious about deep learning can explore that topic first.
{% endmarginnote %} this “[image of thought]( #the-rhizome-as-image-of-nomad-thought)”. My impulse was to consider dynamic, algorithmically generated graphs (with GUIs) as appropriate visualizations: the diagram would be in constant flux as new information enters the system *and* can be manipulated by users (e.g., filtering out certain information, zooming, etc.) But this seemed to be a poor starting point: I haven’t motivated the problem, determined what’s at stake, or what it would mean for these diagrams to be supposedly representing rhizomes. For instance Gergoriou, a Deleuzian scholar argues "The goal is not to represent the rhizome but to implant it in thought. The effect they [Deleuze and Guattari] are after is not the understanding of the rhizome but a functioning, a whole apparatus that connects disparate, linguistic and non-linguistic things" (240). *cite* Thus, I step back and propose a roadmap through which I hope to get to the crux of this problem. 

But before I do, I first provide a little guidance for navigating this page. It’s filled with hyperlinks{% sidenote side1 I’m particularly proud of the [bibliography](#bibliography) section (that is, its technical implementation)--anything that’s clickable opens a new window with the entire source document at your fingertips. A bunch of work went into this feature but I'll spare you the technical details for now. I know I'm enabling mass copyright infringement, but I implore you to suspend disbelief and imagine legality (and, for some, ethics) is not a concern here. I promise that I *think* there's a point to all this. %} and you may have noticed that an `Annotate` button pops up anytime you highlight text. I consider them a recognition of the impossibility of creating a standalone work that explains a given concept once and for all. While I admit there is some recklessness in this idea, I don't think this instability or lack of fixed points implies any more chaos or disorganization than a typical academic paper.{% sidenote side2 For instance, would willful disorganization have a [table of contents](#table-of-contents)? %} Additionally, D&G are of the same mind when it comes to any totalizing project:

{% blockquote Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, *The Anti-Oedipus* (42) %}
We believe only in totalities that are peripheral. And if we discover such a totality alongside various separate parts, it is a whole of these particular parts but does not totalize them; it is a unity of all those particular parts but does not unify them; rather it is added to them as a new part fabricated separately.{% endblockquote %}

While I would rather not repeatedly paraphrase Deleuze and Guattari to elucidate their arguments, this one is worth keeping in mind: *when the sum of the parts become a whole, the whole itself becomes a part*. One metaphor might be assembling an infinite puzzle: while you can connect pieces to form bigger units, there will always exist some disconnected pieces. 


{% marginnote margin3 %} 
{% image /assets/images/checkmate.gif 245 138 raw %}
{% endmarginnote %}

Which reminds me: while I have a [laundry list of references](#references) and [suggestions for further reading](#relevant-literature), this is not a rigorous academic paper. To be plain, *I am playing fast and loose*. I'm going for breadth rather than depth. I view D&G's rhizome as a challenge; perhaps my lack of exhaustive analysis is not a cop out, but an application of rhizomatic thought? I don't buy it. I intend to explain myself and represent my ideas as clearly as possible (which is why I've chosen this format and selected so many visual aids). I would rather be ambitious and fail than limit my scope to something uninteresting and/or unimportant. Thus, I take advantages of abstractions wherever possible. If someone has already explained a concept clearer or more succinctly than I have, why reproduce it when I could merely point you in its direction? Through this lens one might argue that thinking rhizomatically (if this can be considered 'thinking rhizomatically') is an excuse for laziness. Maybe. But if I've already found what I consider to be the answer to a particular problem, why should I put it in different terms? I view myself as a compositor{% sidenote side3 See chapter 3 of [*The Language of New Media*](#manovich) for more on selection and compositing. %} more than anything. If I'm to contribute to scholarship in any meaningful way, it won't be for clever axioms, but for my ability to see how pieces {% marginnote margin4 %} 
Not only is this assignment's deadline ominously looming, but I have [another ambitious project](https://github.com/byrnehollander/connected) due the following day. Which brings me to the advice I generally try to follow: "Never half-ass two things. Full ass one thing."

<!-- Anyway... -->
{% endmarginnote %} might fit together. I hope some interestingness comes of it. Moreover, this leads me to address a logistical issue: this project is primarily a submission for my English seminar. It could be best to consider this project as a kind of starting point for grappling with the rhizome{% sidenote side3 I might be speaking too soon. I spend some time discussing the importance of beginnings in [the next section](#the-rhizome-as-image-of-nomad-thought). %}. In some ways I am overtly essentialist and in other ways I am probably mistaken. I've considered that this might not be *the best way* to discuss the rhizome, but it does seem like a novel approach. Further, it is dynamic and I can continue to refine it--it will not cease to exist for all intents and purposes once it is turned it (though I discuss the ephemerality of the web in [a later place](#this-post-as-a-rhizome)).

Further, the `Annotate` button is an implementation of <a href="http://genius.com/web-annotator" target="_blank">Genius's web annotator</a> which lets you "add line-by-line annotations to any page on the Internet".{% sidenote side4 While there are <a href="https://hypothes.is" target="_blank">other annotating solutions</a>, no other service has a `.js` embed. I'm a big fan of Genius and I hope you consider <a href="http://genius.com/signup" target="_blank">creating an account</a> and annotating something on this page.%}

Anyway, back to the roadmap.{% sidenote side5 That was longwinded. I hope some took my advice to navigate this page non-linearly. %} As I said, this project began with a deceptively simple (or misleading) question: "What would a rhizome *look* like?" I now try to view the concepts on their own level and understand what problems the rhizome looked to solve. In other words, I try to unravel the context from which the concept sprung. 

I begin by summarizing what I consider the spirit of the rhizome project and how it has been applied as a ’tool.’ I explore what it means to think rhizomatically, why one would do so, and its position as either metaphor or literal. I then challenge the definitions of a rhizome and assumptions the authors make to argue that a rhizome’s distinctions from the fascicular root are exaggerated. I employ DeLanda’s technical definitions of Deleuzean concepts to demystify the rhizome. I dwell on the subject of a-signfiying semiotics in order to understand the tangible utility of rhizomes (*clarify*). I continue with a discussion of graphs and visual knowledge. I posit that images can produce knowledge and that learning to read the meaning-producing argument structures of graphical forms implies signification. I further explore the notion of how diagrammatic images spatialize relations in a meaningful way and present Warren Sack’s conversation map and GUI as an early example of dynamic meaning production.

I then consolidate these tools to argue how the Internet is rhizomatic. My main idea is if it is a rhizome, what does it mean? To quote Werner Herzog, “Does the Internet dream of itself?” I explore Ted Nelson’s notion of interwingularity and his vision of a hyper contextual Internet in order to provide a tangible example of how we might represent the interconnectedness of all things. I give examples of static visualizations of the Internet and the knowledge that can be gleaned from this visual representation, what is lost, and what can be gained from other methods.

I continue with a discussion of dimensionality reduction. I challenge D&G’s notion that all is lost in such a reduction and then consider various methods for achieving reduction. I briefly note the politics of data and reduction. I consider deep learning methods as a way of continually showing change where information from previous generations informs the next one. 

Next, I consider the notion that ATP itself is a rhizome. I consider how its status as closed system interacts with the open system that is its connections— how the dimensions of time and space manipulate their meanings. With the examples of the internet and ATP now fleshed out, I consider the prospect of creating protocols that generalize knowledge and signify both visually and textually. What would it mean for this post itself to be rhizomatic? That it can be negotiated non-linearly? I conclude with a list of references and provide source material when possible (definitely a breach of copyright law - can see them all [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sqcp8cy6wyqpcjh/AADNMp_5haQBLpWzk025u-k0a?dl=0)). 


# The Rhizome as Image of Nomad Thought
Structure seems to be the overarching theme of <a href id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a>. It is a book rife with geological and botanical metaphors, a book that seeks to explain space and relations within this space. It is a book of constant motion and instability. It is a book they claim is a rhizome with 'plateaus' in place of chapters. "Each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau." (22) Further, their rhizome "has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle (*milieu*) from which it grows and which it overspills". (21) While they admit "it's not easy to see things in the middle, rather than looking down on them from above or up at them from below, or from left to right or right to left," they argue it is the only way to see things. Rhizomatic writing is not written from a sedentary view: they assemble heterogeneity and do not seek fundamental unity. Thus, the question of where to begin seems strikingly lacking for nomadic writing. What can be our foundation if we begin *in media res*?
<!-- need to fix link -->
{% blockquote Gilles Deleuze, <a href id="drx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Difference and Repetition</em> (129) %}
Where to begin in philosophy has always--rightly--been regarded as a very delicate problem, for beginning means eliminating all presuppositions. However, whereas in science one is confronted by objective presuppositions which axiomatic rigour can eliminate, presuppositions in philosophy are as much subjective as objective.
{% endblockquote %}
Yet, it is by confronting this important problem that Deleuze understands that there is no simple answer.{% sidenote side1 **Reading suggestion**: Chapter III - The Image of Thought though I'll cover some of it here %}

Perhaps the start is never the beginning-- how can we tackle the issue of presuppositions? In <a href id="dar" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01YVBwdWh0NXFIaWc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Difference and Repetition</em></a>, Deleuze argues that most of philosophy was founded on the notion of common sense as *cogitatio natura universalis* (good will of the thinker and good nature of thought). He calls this thinking the 'pre-philosophical image of thought' because it fails to question the nature of thought and being. This particular image of thought implies that "thought has an affinity with the true; it formally possesses the true and materially wants the true. It is in terms of this image that everybody knows and is presumed to know what it means to think." This Image, according to Deleuze, "prejudges everything" and thus can be called a "dogmatic, orthodox or moral image". In questioning the absoluteness of morality, Deleuze concludes that the conditions of a philosophy which would be without any kind of presuppositions are such: instead of being supported by the moral Image of thought, it would take as its point of departure a radical critique of this Image and the 'postulates' it implies. It would find its difference or its true beginning, not in an agreement with the pre-philosophical Image but in a rigorous struggle against this Image, which it would denounce as non-philosophical. As a result, it would discover its authentic repetition in a thought without Image." (page 131)

"Deleuze opposes the genetic approach to thought to the discourse of the conditions of knowledge" (Dronsfield, Jonathan. Deleuze and the Image of Thought)
the “absence of presuppositions” is the true beginning in philosophy: the absence of determinate concepts 

The ultimate distinction is the lack of foundation from which to build-- there is not truth out there. Likewise, Derrida's trace is rejected for having a Structure - as radical as it may be, there is still meaning. The root versus rhizome:

Lambert 52
What is subtracted is a vertical dimension that allows its form to be grasped from another perspective that is posed as its higher unity. Again, it is a flat surface composed horizontally that remains perfectly abstract in that it is drawn in relation toa plane of immanence that, in turn, it does not seek to represent as an image of the world. It is purely immanent to the plane on which it appears as a plateau or partial region of the plane, like the manner in which weeds appear like patchwork on a meadow.

I think the important take away is that a graph of the root is iterating towards theoretically realizable edges (i.e., connections between concepts). Still it is a meaning not stable enough to subsist off. Likewise, it is not clear that concepts of different kinds can be on the same graph. Barthes and Derrida: Lambert (52): process of rewriting, reweaving, and grafting of all of the fragments and missing parts in a “Total Work or Magnum Opus.” Delaying a totalizing image while consciousness is out there. And if the totalized image can only exist if consciousness does not to manipulate it, what's the point? Still, it is about the structure of the world and what we are based off.

it represents an externalization of the machinic dimension of Deleuze and Guattari’s philosophy, a machine that literally presents us with the following situation: Contemporary philosophy is an assemblage that presupposes a new image of thought on the plane of immanence." {% sidenote side2 Lambert, [*In Search of a New Image of Thought*](#lambert), 45. %}

Deleuze provides an ontology of relationships: everything is connected to everything else no matter how different they seem to be. I disagree- some things can be more strongly connected. Take two slightly different sequences of DNA that end up expressing the same gene. They are more strongly connected to each other than either sequence to any painting. 


**How do you connect (i.e. create a map of) that which has no structure?** The mystical. The idea that this structure is not given or even able to manifest itself. **There exists a map, that much is for sure. Everything is on the map. Everything is connected.**

Can we create a universal protocol to describe connections? If there is no underlying truth and everything is in chaos, impossible. But we can create heuristics for defining similarity. None are absolutely verifiably true, but what is this notion that everything is mystically connected and there is no total? Always moving and with no total, but we define connections. This is an idea of pagerank and using hypertext to mark relationships between html pages. But the pages themselves have concepts- how do we separate them out? Thus, we have a gradient. In continuous space, we don't need to specify who is closest, but everything's relationship to everything else. 

In other words, the rhizome suggests the “subterranean” presence of connections; but theories of systems and emergent phenomena provide a more explicitly technological model to describe how these connections can be established, actualized, and experienced - this is the mystical?

We have the tools to generate new concepts - monkey and typewriters except their typewriters only have suggested phrases that they select at random. This is the infinite deferral of totalization. What if the goal is not to totalize what will be, but to show the current state of things? Context. Somewhat reminds me of the impossibility of proving the lack of free will through simulation because not enough atoms in the universe. 


## Rhizome as mystical or metaphor
Here lies the jump: from Difference and Repetition to A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze decided that the notion of starting in the middle can be adequately represented by borrwing the rhizome from botany. Not particularly clear how this is different from the root-maybe the rhizome as a root that doesn't know which way is up. To remind you that it doesn't matter which way is up- it's all relative to a fixed point anyway.

But that isn't enough to separate the ideas about structure and heterogeneity. “A rhizome ceaselessly establishes connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.” There is no proper territory, and moreover, no proper language. Signs of art can be placed in conjunction with signs of politics or organizations of power 

Per graph theory, we can convert horizontal movements (lines of flight) into nodes and vertices. So far, the rhizome image is holding up. But then we get this idea that every node is connected to every other node. This is unclear-- is there a direct connection between each node or is it simply that there exists a path from *x* to *y*? I'll give D&G the benefit of the doubt and presume they mean the latter. (“any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be.” it's ambiguous. actually doesn't matter which method. if there's a path through connection, value of that path can be the edge weight between vertex *x* and *y*. Still, it is easier to represent the relationships if we have paths rather than weighted graphs.) Still, how do we compare a strand of DNA to a painting? They would need to share some attributes, or for there to be a path that has enough attributes in common. So in spite of the heterogeneity of the nodes, each is generic enough to be comparable or they could not exist on the same assemblage. This seems tautological: if there is a mapping and they are connected, there must exist a method to compute connection or else they would not be connected. I think D&G might agree with this, but perhaps mystify it by saying they are in constant motion and unstable so any connection is temporary or that they are connected by a function, but that function is unknowable. Makes me think of computability theory. But if it were not computable, how could relationships as such exist? (randomness and not computable - Chaitin's constant) Further, there is a map. THe universe's algorithm *always* returns an answer.
Further, it neglects heterogeneity by placing everything on the same level. While it does show that everything is on the same assemblage, it is a poor figure for representing a break from the root which was (I think) more homogeneous. 

aspects where technical terms can actually clarify (against french physicists)
Mathematics of multiplicities - thankfully DeLanda has demystified many of his concepts by finding analogs for (Although the egg metaphor does provide a vivid illustration of the distinction I am trying to draw here, it is nevertheless just a useful analogy. Fortunately, there are technical ways of defining the idea of progressive differentiation which do not rely on metaphors. pg 9)

DeLanda Page 5:
“A Deleuzian multiplicity takes as its first defining feature these two traits of a manifold: its variable number of dimensions and, more importantly, the absence of a supplementary (higher) dimension imposing an extrinsic coordinatization, and hence, an extrinsically de ned unity. As Deleuze writes: “Multiplicity must not designate a combination of the many and the one, but rather an organization belonging to the many as such, which has no need whatsoever of unity in order to form a system.”4 Essences, on the other hand, do possess a defining unity (e.g. the unity of rationality and animality defining the human essence) and, moreover, are taken to exist in a transcendent space which serves as a container for them or in which they are embedded. A multiplicity, on the other hand, “however many dimensions it may have, . . . never has a supplementary dimension to that which transpires upon it. This alone makes it natural and immanent.”5”

This is exactly how Galloway argues the Internet is not rhizomatic-- for its use in protcol. Network as opposed to metaphor. “The first point is that networks are not metaphors. As Galloway states, “Protocols do not perform any interpretation themselves; that is, they encapsulate information inside various wrappers, while remaining relatively indifferent to the content of information contained within.” The concept of “protocol” is thus meant to demonstrate the nonmetaphorical quality of networks. Or, put another way, the concept of protocol shows the predilection for general discussion of networks in terms of general tropes. Networks are not tropes for notions of “interconnection.” They are material technologies, sites of variable practices, actions, and movements. This is, perhaps, stated too strongly. Yes, metaphors do materialize and corporealize, and, in some sense, metaphor is consonant with language itself. But discussions of networks— especially in cultural theory—have too often slipped into “vapor theory,” eliding a specific consideration of the material substrate and infrastructure with a general discussion of links, webs, and globalized connectivity.”

"Rather, this abstract-but-real is the network that is always enacted and always about to enact itself. One can pose the question: Is a network a network if it is not being used?”
- Turn it into a network in order to use the idea as more than as a non-virtual abstract concept
- “The network as real-but-abstract may involve “information” as an immaterial entity, but that information always works toward real effects and transformations, no matter how localized.”

So every rhizome is a map is a network. We just don't know the protocol. (Yes, under this new definition of rhizome, the Internet fulfills all the qualifications. I discuss possible diagrams for the Internet below.)

definitely check out ATP's distinction between tree, root, and rhizome and the 6 characteristics of the rhizome. overview not that important tbh
Goodchild reminds us that "these principles do not remain separate but mix with each other and proliferate" (1996: 85). In other words, we should bear in mind that they do not function in isolation, but only together as a rhizome. The rhizomatic method would ideally involve negotiating through all of these principles simultaneously so that they can proliferate in the reader's mind. I'll allow it. I don't think it stops me.

56 the image of thought presupposed by the rhizome system is that of a map and not that of tracing a preexisting structure or genealogical inheritance
What Deleuze and Guattari call the principles of cartography and decalcomania repeats the argument of the notion of a plane of consistency that “is not amenable to any structural or generative model"
- BUT maps can be genealogical. In one generation, we can add, remove, or reweight vertices. The context has changed so the concept has too is their likely argument. While everything might have reprocussions on everything else (and does, according to them), that doesn't mean they are fundamentally uncomparable between generations. If everything exists on a continuum, why can't things merely shift rather than be destroyed. Still doesn't find the meaning, but creates it

I really hope this is enough motivation to keep reading!

Twelve years later, however, it appears that thought *can* have an image that is not pre-philosophical. And it is the notion that philosophy begins with the rhizome.

While it appears that the rhizome is our beginning, I must set the stage with a discussion of botany. As Christy Wampole illustrates in *Rootedness*, botanical metaphors--especially those of the tree and root--have long been used to efficiently say what is otherwise extremely difficult or even impossible to communicate. Further motivating the importance of botanical terminology, Wapole notes critical theory's reintroduction of the idea that "thought itself is botanical in nature and that humans should look toward plants as a model for dwelling in the world, because they provide an alternate paradigm for the treatment of space, time, consumption, and death." {% sidenote side1 Wampole, [*Rootedness*](#wampole), 4-5. %}

1987 definition of a rhizome
The rhizome multiple must be made ... a rhizome as subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radicles. Bulbs and tubers are rhizomes. . . Rats are rhizomes.
Burrows are too, in all of their functions of shelters, supply,
movement, evasion, and breakout. The rhizome itself assumes
very diverse forms, from ramified surface extension in all directions to concretion into bulbs and tubers. When rats
swarm over each other. The rhizome includes the best and the
worst: potato and couchgrass, or the weed. (

Freeing thought to let it become vital

Not either tree or pure rhizome fin: a becoming of pedagogies
learning takes place in encountering the unknown and improvisation


<!-- I now, as Deleuze and Guattari do in the introduction to *A Thousand Plateaus* describe the three major botanical figures: the [Tree](#the-tree), [the Root](#the-radicle-system-or-fascicular-root), and the [Rhizome](#the-rhizome). But before I do, want a brief aside about the metaphor. -->

Don't want it treated as a metaphor and "Gregoriou rightly explained that the rhizome must be rescued from its "literary over-coding in a pedagogical discourse as a metaphor for excessive multiplicity and radical openness. The rhizome must be made" (2004, p. 246, emphasis in origin). I think I agree. But they chose a bad subject to co-opt. It isn't different enough from the root model and introduces its own kind of skepticism. How did this happen?

Lambert 60
Rhizome failure
As I have already implied, Deleuze and Guattari s rhizomatic experiment might be judged today as a failure, given that it was perceived as too abstract and appeared to convince no one, particularly not philosophers themselves. 

Hyperliteralizing
When you hyperliteralize the rhizome, you lost all metaphor (of a certain kind) in exchange for a different kind of abstraction
- Supposed to be useful, after all; how is a rhizome different from a recommendation engine; a consideration of where to go next
- Application beyond the internet

Wampole 222: “penchant for mysticism” – by replacing argument with a flurry of pictures, they imagine they’ll change minds, since the human is such a visual creature. We no longer choose and commit to one picture; we accumulate in shuffle them
- Multiple simultaneously but constantly shifting—the idea of “time slices”

Wampole 223: “In the end, the rhizome is not radically different from the root. It is still an embedded form, its pace of growth is the same, and it represents yet another instance of thinking botanically about thought.”
- Rhizome as nonbinary, nonhierarchical epistemology
- “Thinking takes place in the ground” – would it help us for computers to do this thinking? There’s a rhizome in every tree, after all

Celebration of multiplicity, of dissolved categories, of the horizontalization of all aspects of life
- No reason to not place things on a continuum in computational analysis

Limitations and deficiencies – a performance of self-doubt (page 224)

Wampole 227: “the rhizome’s vegetal matter does not last long enough to tell a tale and its surface is not dense enough to be inscribed with any lasting message. Any inscription on the rhizome would decompose along with it”
- How generations preemptively mark generations to come
- Very much in process but you can see what’s going on while processing is perpetually going on behind the scenes
- Could argue that I’m taking the forms too literally, but if they really are not metaphors, how else is one to take them?

Seeking the truth but unwittingly obfuscating through an endless series of speculative gesture. What truth can we find in n-dimensional reduction?

Rather than root on paper, expand it into a four-dimensional phenomenon, plastic and dynamic in time and space
- Paradoxical to capture a line of flight; the moment as multiple things pass into one each other at varying degrees

Wampole 231: rhizome still has “points of interest”, with lines intersecting to form meaningful junctions
- Is this not radical enough? How radical and abstract can we make the idea while it still being a useful tool? Does it matter if it's a useful tool?
- Building blocks of the rhizome described as molecules, atoms, particles, genes, and other microscopic units

Lines of flight describe the volatile vectors of the rhizome (page 232)
- Stochastic modelling? Chaos? Spurns stability and formal predictability

“Favoring production over reproduction, ‘a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model’ (12)” (233)
- Dichotomy between production and reproduction; can’t we have it both ways?

Becoming > Being
- If always passing from multiple becomings to multiple becomings, at what point do we simply call them beings?

Cynical French physicists in *Fashionable nonsense* call it a result of longstanding abuse of scientic jargon:
“one sees that there is a great concentration of scientific terms, employed out of context and without any apparent logic, at least if one attributes to these terms their usual scientific meanings. To be sure, Deleuze and Guattari are free to use these terms in other senses: science has no monopoly on the use of words like “chaos”, “limit” or “energy”. But, as we shall show, their writings are crammed also with highly technical terms that are not used outside of specialized scientific discourses, and for which they provide no alternative definition.
These texts touch on a great variety of subjects: Gödel’s theorem, the theory of transfinite cardinals, Riemannian geometry, quantum mechanics …198 But the allusions are so brief and superficial that a reader who is not already an expert in these subjects will be unable to learn anything concrete. And a specialist reader will find their statements most often meaningless, or sometimes acceptable but banal and confused.
We are well aware that Deleuze and Guattari’s subject is philosophy, not the popularization of science. But what philosophical function can be fulfilled by this avalanche of ill-digested scientific (and pseudo-scientific) jargon? In our opinion, the most plausible explanation is that these authors possess a vast but very superficial erudition, which they put on display in their writings.”

Wampole 216ish: “D&G retrained in their writing on the rhizome some of the mystical features of writers like Claudel, Heidegger, and Weil” – demystify


“What are some common metaphoric uses of networks that Protocol resists? One is that networks are synonymous with connectivity (and that connectivity is always good). Tropes of links, nets, webs, and a general relationality also stem from this use of networks. Pop science writing on network science or the gee-whiz rhetoric of magazines such as Wired often adopt a quantitative politics: If information wants to be free, then more connectivity equals more freedom.”
“But the concept of “protocol” is as concerned with disconnection as it is with connectivity. The moment of disconnectivity is the moment when protocol most forcefully displays its political character. Disconnectivity can occur in a number of ways, from a personal dialup disconnected due to a time limit imposed by a commercial ISP, to the management (or surveillance) of large-scale networks involved in political activism. The analysis in part III below of hacking, computer viruses, and the tactical appropriation of both by cyberfeminism provides a set of examples for how disconnectivity can be as instrumental for protocol’s (mal)functioning as is connectivity.”

Do the politics of this disconnectivity affect the Bhopal community itself? Do policies regarding information content (DMCA) actually encourage such regulation? These are complex questions which have arisen from this event, one that has been made possible by the dual nature of the Internet that Protocol points to: its horizontality (community networks; TCP/IP) and its verticality (its stratification; DNS).

Wampole 216: “Ihab Hassan, Emily Apter, and others” have asserted that the twentieth century represents a shift from the root-based epistemology to a rhizomatic one

Thus, I get to the crux of my argument. The concept of the rhizome has a basis for claiming it is not metaphorical, but what do these assumptions mean? How does it really differ from a root and how can we visualize it?

In botany, a **rhizome** is a horizontal underground plant stem capable of producing the shoot and root systems of a new plant. Below is an illustration of the network structure that enables mushrooms to absorb nutrients from their environment.

is a concept to understand the image of thought. Shatter linearity - More total for being fragmented
Intention is to shatter "the linear unity of knowledge", stating that "this time, the principal root has aborted, or its tip has been destroyed: an immediate, indefinite multiplicity of secondary roots grats unto it and undergoes aflourishing development (6). Replacing "root-cosmos" with "radicle-chaosmos" provide radical critical perspectives on recent semantic visions to be realized by means of computational ontologies, which fuel the Semantic Web vision.

Rhizome as a style of thought
To oversimplify, the rhizome functions through lateral proliferation rather than tree-like vertical extension.

Deleuze and Guattari themselves caution that "the root-tree and canal-rhizome are not two opposed models" (20).  The concept of the rhizome was set up precisely to challenge dichotomous branching; yet by placing rhizome against tree, how can we ignore the self-contradictory dualism? 
<!-- {% image /assets/images/intro-paragraph-19.jpg 2000 1550 %} -->

[t]he problem of writing: in order to designate something exactly, anexact [sic] expressions are utterly unavoidable. We invoke one dualism only in order to challenge another.  We employ a dualism of models only in order to arrive at a process that challenges all models.  (20)

Each element within our collective biosphere will need to be carefully tracked, interrelating multiple factors such as geologic and climatic conditions, predatory traits, and life cycles. In this complex and multidimensional data environment, the role of visualization will be key in pro- viding the capacity to recognize the emergent patterns and processes of these phenomena. Visualization will itself become organic, as it will need to adapt to simu- late information from a wide spectrum of sources, ranging from micro/organic to macro/planetary states. The role of arti cial intelligence will be critical in creating this new cybernetic form of resistance, revealing abnormal trends and anomalies and giving us the ability to utilize resources

Wampole 252 “To specialize is to decontextualize”  Specialization is in response to the simple fact that the world and what is knowable have become too big for the brain to handle. We favor a more manageable smallness over unwieldy largeness and thus break civilization down into composites. By focusing on what is immediate and summarizable, we forfeit our own context. Without context meaning breaks down

Ultimately, it seems that the distinction between trace and rhizome is that a trace is sometimes amenable

 “The tracing has already translated the map into an image; it has already transformed the rhizome into roots and radicals.”20 Here we can see the precise problem: the book machine as root system and the radical system as infinite textuality always return to extinguish the possible creation of the rhizome. They return again to reproduce hierarchies, or to dissipate the lateral movement of connections in a sterile form of a Structure

Network-as-diagram based on the Deluzean concept of diagram; “Protocol considers networks through a “diagram,” a term borrowed from Gilles Deleuze. Protocol considers first a network as a set of nodes and edges, dots and lines. The dots may be computers (server, client, or both), human users, communities, LANs, corporations, even countries. The lines can be any practice, action, or event effectuated by the dots (downloading, emailing, connecting, encrypting, buying, logging on, port scanning). With this basic “diagram” you can do a number of things. You can connect the dots—all of them—making a totally connected, distributed network with more than one path to the destination. You can also disconnect dots, even delete dots (no paths, no destination). You can filter out which dots are connected to the network. You can create portals for the addition of future dots. You can designate which kinds of lines you want between the dots (for not all lines are equal; some diverge, flee; others converge, coalesce). In short, a network-as-diagram offers all sorts of possibilities for organization, regulation, and management.”

# How the Internet is rhizomatic

read from page 11 in protocol  


So to equate the Web with the rhizome, one must argue against those who describe the Web as a free, structureless network, and argue for a certain kind of rhizomatic protocol on the Web. This is a discussion already underway in chapter 1 and in the introduction.


Indeed, the Internet works too well. If the Internet were truly rhizomatic, it would resist identification. It would resist the deep, meaningful uses that people make of it everyday. The Net is not narrative-based, or time-based. But it still enthralls users, dragging them in, as television and cinema did before it. How? The answer is in the form.

- 
- to resist identification - how is resisting meaningful uses relate to its idea of not being a metaphor?


Internet is in part compelling because of its continuity - its ability to use the application layer to create a compelling, intuitive experience for the user
- thus, must likewise create continuity within a deep learning network
Galloway differentiates the Internet from the rhizome: “the Web is structured around rigid protocols that govern the transfer and representation of texts and images—so the Web isn’t “an acentered, nonhierarchical, nonsignifying system” as is Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome” (61-2). I don’t think the Web’s protocols mean it is acentered or hierarchical (it’s still decentralized), but the nonsignifying aspect does seem to be the key differentiator. However, if we concede that a rhizome can in fact signify, I don’t see why we cannot physically represent a rhizome.
lines can be turned into nodes where a node is a semiotic chain

connectedness - unclear if graph theory meaning or means that there is a direct connection (i.e., vertex between each node); Galloway’s depiction of a distributed network on page 35 makes me think it’s the former and that X can reach Y (and vice versa) through several paths 

Protocol-
Founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language, code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary analysis as any natural language; computer languages have their own syntax, grammar, communities, and cultures.

Galloway argues that such protocols are the way that control is exercised in our globalized “network society,” one where power is “distributed” laterally, rather than being hierarchically structured, stratified, and centralized, or even (merely) “decentralized.” A distributed network is a rhizome rather than a tree 
Centralized- single host by which radial nodes are attached
A network can also have multiple hosts, each with its own set of satellite nodes


Comparison of distributed networks to Deleuze (pg 11 galloway)

the distributed network is an entirely different matter. Distributed networks are native to Deleuze’s control societies. Each point in a distributed network is neither a central hub nor a satellite node—there are neither trunks nor leaves. The network contains nothing but “intelligent end-point systems that are self-deterministic, allowing each end-point system to communicate with any host it chooses.”15 Like the rhizome, each node in a distributed network may establish direct communication with another node, without having to appeal to a hierarchical intermediary. Yet in order to initiate communication, the two nodes must speak the same language. This is why protocol is important. Shared protocols are what defines the landscape of the network—who is connected to whom.
- Nodes must speak the same language – pointing at radical heterogeneity of stratum

33 galloway: A perfect example of a distributed network is the rhizome described in Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus. Reacting specifically to what they see as the totalitarianism inherent in centralized and even decentralized networks, Deleuze and Guattari instead describe the rhizome, a horizontal meshwork derived from botany. The rhizome links many autonomous nodes together in a manner that is neither linear nor hierarchical. Rhizomes are heterogeneous and connective, that is to say, “any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other.”6 They are also multiple and asymmetrical: “[a] rhizome may be broken, shattered at a given spot, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines.”7 Further, the rhizome has complete disregard for depth models, or procedures of derivation. As Deleuze and Guattari write, a rhizome “is a stranger to any idea of genetic axis

[U]nlike trees or their roots, the rhizome connects any point to any other point . . . The rhizome is reducible neither to the One nor the multiple. . . . It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion.

some of the assertions don’t seem airtight: rhizome “is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion”

these edges / directions in motions can be turned into edges

everything analog can be represented digitally without a loss of information
- Although we can emulate analog processes to any desired degree of accuracy with digital computation, we lose several orders of magnitude of efficiency in doing so. A single transistor can multiply two values represented as analog levels; doing so with digital circuits requires thousands of transistors. California Institute of Technology’s Carver Mead has been pioneering this concept; See Carver A. Mead, “Neuromorphic Electronic Systems,” IEEE Proceedings 78.10 (October 1990): 1629–36.

The story goes that the Internet is rhizomatic. On the one hand, the Web is structured around rigid protocols that govern the transfer and representation of texts and images—so the Web isn’t “an acentered, nonhierarchical, nonsignifying system” as is Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome. But on the other hand, the Web seems to mirror several of the key characteristics of the rhizome: the ability of any node to be connected to any other node, the rule of multiplicity, the ability to splinter off or graft on at any point, the rejection of a “deep structure,” and so forth.
The Web is described as a free, structureless network. Yet the rhizome is clearly not the absence of structure. It is the privileging of a certain kind of structure, the horizontal network, over another structure, the tree. So to equate the Web with the rhizome, one must argue against those who describe the Web as a free, structureless network, and argue for a certain kind of rhizomatic protocol on the Web. This is a discussion already underway in chapter 1 and in the introduction.


The project of this book is to show that protocol is in fact both poles of this machinic movement, territorializing structure and anarchical distribution. So the question is, How exactly does protocol sew together the apparatus of digital computing into an intelligible object? Why is the Internet such an enthralling technology? How does it work so well while remaining anarchic?
Indeed, the Internet works too well. If the Internet were truly rhizomatic, it would resist identification. It would resist the deep, meaningful uses that people make of it everyday. The Net is not narrative-based, or time-based. But it still enthralls users, dragging them in, as television and cinema did before it. How? The answer is in the form.
One concept that I will borrow from film theory is continuity. Despite being a decentralized network composed of many different data fragments, the Internet is able to use the application layer to create a compelling, intuitive experience for the user. This is the secret of continuity.

Why does being rhizomatic inherently mean that it resists identification; derived by their definition, right? same with no “organizing memory or central automation”

why can’t a rhizome have protocol?

interface of representation - how do semiotic chains interact?

deep understanding and digitally-mediated deliberation

no perfect representation of thought; only models. how good will they be? I don't know.

Each rectangle is a vector and arrows represent functions (e.g. matrix multiply). Input vectors are in red, output vectors are in blue and green vectors hold the RNN's state (more on this soon). From left to right: **(1)** Vanilla mode of processing without RNN, from fixed-sized input to fixed-sized output (e.g. image classification). **(2)** Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words). **(3)** Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment). **(4)** Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French). **(5)** Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video). Notice that in every case are no pre-specified constraints on the lengths sequences because the recurrent transformation (green) is fixed and can be applied as many times as we like.
