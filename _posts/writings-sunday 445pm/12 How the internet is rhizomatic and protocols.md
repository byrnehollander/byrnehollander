# How the Internet is rhizomatic

## Galloway's *Protocols*
Galloway differentiates the Internet from the rhizome: “the Web is structured around rigid protocols that govern the transfer and representation of texts and images—so the Web isn’t “an acentered, nonhierarchical, nonsignifying system” as is Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome” (61-2). I don’t think the Web’s protocols mean it is acentered or hierarchical (it’s still decentralized), but the nonsignifying aspect does seem to be the key differentiator. However, if we concede that a rhizome can in fact signify, I don’t see why we cannot physically represent a rhizome.
lines can be turned into nodes where a node is a semiotic chain

connectedness - unclear if graph theory meaning or means that there is a direct connection (i.e., vertex between each node); Galloway’s depiction of a distributed network on page 35 makes me think it’s the former and that X can reach Y (and vice versa) through several paths 

Protocol-
Founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language, code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary analysis as any natural language; computer languages have their own syntax, grammar, communities, and cultures.

Galloway argues that such protocols are the way that control is exercised in our globalized “network society,” one where power is “distributed” laterally, rather than being hierarchically structured, stratified, and centralized, or even (merely) “decentralized.” A distributed network is a rhizome rather than a tree 
Centralized- single host by which radial nodes are attached
A network can also have multiple hosts, each with its own set of satellite nodes


Comparison of distributed networks to Deleuze (pg 11 galloway)

the distributed network is an entirely different matter. Distributed networks are native to Deleuze’s control societies. Each point in a distributed network is neither a central hub nor a satellite node—there are neither trunks nor leaves. The network contains nothing but “intelligent end-point systems that are self-deterministic, allowing each end-point system to communicate with any host it chooses.”15 Like the rhizome, each node in a distributed network may establish direct communication with another node, without having to appeal to a hierarchical intermediary. Yet in order to initiate communication, the two nodes must speak the same language. This is why protocol is important. Shared protocols are what defines the landscape of the network—who is connected to whom.
- Nodes must speak the same language – pointing at radical heterogeneity of stratum

33 galloway: A perfect example of a distributed network is the rhizome described in Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus. Reacting specifically to what they see as the totalitarianism inherent in centralized and even decentralized networks, Deleuze and Guattari instead describe the rhizome, a horizontal meshwork derived from botany. The rhizome links many autonomous nodes together in a manner that is neither linear nor hierarchical. Rhizomes are heterogeneous and connective, that is to say, “any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other.”6 They are also multiple and asymmetrical: “[a] rhizome may be broken, shattered at a given spot, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines.”7 Further, the rhizome has complete disregard for depth models, or procedures of derivation. As Deleuze and Guattari write, a rhizome “is a stranger to any idea of genetic axis

[U]nlike trees or their roots, the rhizome connects any point to any other point . . . The rhizome is reducible neither to the One nor the multiple. . . . It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion.

some of the assertions don’t seem airtight: rhizome “is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion”

these edges / directions in motions can be turned into edges

everything analog can be represented digitally without a loss of information
- Although we can emulate analog processes to any desired degree of accuracy with digital computation, we lose several orders of magnitude of efficiency in doing so. A single transistor can multiply two values represented as analog levels; doing so with digital circuits requires thousands of transistors. California Institute of Technology’s Carver Mead has been pioneering this concept; See Carver A. Mead, “Neuromorphic Electronic Systems,” IEEE Proceedings 78.10 (October 1990): 1629–36.

The story goes that the Internet is rhizomatic. On the one hand, the Web is structured around rigid protocols that govern the transfer and representation of texts and images—so the Web isn’t “an acentered, nonhierarchical, nonsignifying system” as is Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome. But on the other hand, the Web seems to mirror several of the key characteristics of the rhizome: the ability of any node to be connected to any other node, the rule of multiplicity, the ability to splinter off or graft on at any point, the rejection of a “deep structure,” and so forth.
The Web is described as a free, structureless network. Yet the rhizome is clearly not the absence of structure. It is the privileging of a certain kind of structure, the horizontal network, over another structure, the tree. So to equate the Web with the rhizome, one must argue against those who describe the Web as a free, structureless network, and argue for a certain kind of rhizomatic protocol on the Web. This is a discussion already underway in chapter 1 and in the introduction.


The project of this book is to show that protocol is in fact both poles of this machinic movement, territorializing structure and anarchical distribution. So the question is, How exactly does protocol sew together the apparatus of digital computing into an intelligible object? Why is the Internet such an enthralling technology? How does it work so well while remaining anarchic?
Indeed, the Internet works too well. If the Internet were truly rhizomatic, it would resist identification. It would resist the deep, meaningful uses that people make of it everyday. The Net is not narrative-based, or time-based. But it still enthralls users, dragging them in, as television and cinema did before it. How? The answer is in the form.
One concept that I will borrow from film theory is continuity. Despite being a decentralized network composed of many different data fragments, the Internet is able to use the application layer to create a compelling, intuitive experience for the user. This is the secret of continuity.

Why does being rhizomatic inherently mean that it resists identification; derived by their definition, right? same with no “organizing memory or central automation”

why can’t a rhizome have protocol?

interface of representation - how do semiotic chains interact?

deep understanding and digitally-mediated deliberation

how much do representations of the world change when new things happen?

would be more meaningful if computer scientists tried being philosophers rather than philosophers being computer scientists / mathematicians; point being that technical background is necessary to tackle problem
