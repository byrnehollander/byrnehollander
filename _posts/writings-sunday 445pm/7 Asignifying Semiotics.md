algorithm as asignifying

I want to ascertain if the rhizome is inherently a-signifying and thus if it is possible (or even productive) to create a model to physically represent a rhizome.

In A Thousand Plateaus, the rhizome is defined as a nonsignifying system. Further, it is not a structure as it is made only of lines. Going off this definition, there doesn’t seem to be any logic in representing a system that doesn’t signify anything, especially when the system lacks structure. However, I found it unsatisfying that something described with spatial metaphors lacks the possibility of physical representation (i.e., drawn or generated) and want to see if it’s possible to challenge a couple key parts of the definition (mostly principles five and six on page 12) of Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome. I also don’t think principle four— that of asignifying rupture (page 9)— implies that the rhizome itself is asignifying.

First, I don’t quite understand why a rhizome’s lines cannot be translated into a structure where the lines become a graph with both vertices and nodes. Is there a compelling reason for this that I’m missing? Why can’t a “direction in motion” become a start and end point where each node is a semiotic chain? Putting the problems of discretizing a semiotic chain on hold, if this is then possible, I’m not so sure a rhizome is a-signifying.

To move to another text, in Protocol Galloway differentiates the Internet from the rhizome: “the Web is structured around rigid protocols that govern the transfer and representation of texts and images—so the Web isn’t “an acentered, nonhierarchical, nonsignifying system” as is Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome” (61-2). I don’t think the Web’s protocols mean it is acentered or hierarchical (it’s still decentralized), but the nonsignifying aspect does seem to be the key differentiator. However, if we concede that a rhizome can in fact signify, I don’t see why we cannot physically represent a rhizome. 

I still haven’t totally thought this through, but I can imagine an algorithmic protocol that generates structural representations of a rhizome. Because any change creates a new rhizome, we would begin with a seed at level 0 (I am only using level to represent stages of a rhizome’s generation, not hierarchically) and level 1 would include all semiotic chains that directly relate to that idea (i.e., all ‘directions in motion’ that include the seed would be in level 1). We would continue as such until either all possible semiotic chains in the rhizome in question (one rhizome could be, as is suggested in A Thousand Plateaus, that book itself). Once this rhizome is constructed (and as its being constructed), any change creates a new rhizome. I think this problem may be neutralized through a recurrent neural network using the long short-term memory architecture. (http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) If we stochastially assign probablities to movements and the degree of such movements, we can theoretically model a rhizome as it infinitely changes; at each stage, we have simply a freeze frame of the rhizome at a given moment.

Some of the difficulties here seem to be in discretizing each semiotic chain; this seems particularly subjective, so any representation of a rhizome would be limited in the sense that it can likely be represented in many other ways. 

Code is process-based: It is parsed, compiled, procedural or object-oriented, and defined by ontology standards

algorithmically generate a rhizome

any change creates a new rhizome (which, to me, seems like the very definition of generative)

we can emulate analog processes to any desired degree of accuracy with digital computation

spatial metaphor

Felt very unsatisfying that something described with spatial metaphors lacks a physical representation

lines can be turned into nodes where a node is a semiotic chain

connectedness - unclear if graph theory meaning or means that there is a direct connection (i.e., vertex between each node); Galloway’s depiction of a distributed network on page 35 makes me think it’s the former and that X can reach Y (and vice versa) through several paths
