In this essay I aim to demystify Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome as described in their 1980 book *A Thousand Plateaus*. I begin by summarizing what I consider the spirit of the rhizome project and how it has been applied as a ’tool.’ I explore what it means to think rhizomatically, why one would do so, and its position as either metaphor or literal. I then challenge the definitions of a rhizome and assumptions the authors make to argue that a rhizome’s distinctions from the fascicular root are exaggerated. I employ DeLanda’s technical definitions of Deleuzean concepts to demystify the rhizome. I dwell on the subject of a-signfiying semiotics in order to understand the tangible utility of rhizomes (*clarify*). I continue with a discussion of graphs and visual knowledge. I posit that images can produce knowledge and that learning to read the meaning-producing argument structures of graphical forms implies signification. I further explore the notion of how diagrammatic images spatialize relations in a meaningful way and present Warren Sack’s conversation map and GUI as an early example of dynamic meaning production. I briefly discuss the idea of [semantic networks](http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/semantic_networks.htm) as rhizomatic.

I then consolidate these tools to argue how the Internet is rhizomatic. My main idea is if it is a rhizome, what does it mean? To quote Werner Herzog, “Does the Internet dream of itself?” I explore Ted Nelson’s notion of interwingularity and his vision of a hyper contextual Internet in order to provide a tangible example of how we might represent the interconnectedness of all things. I give examples of static visualizations of the Internet and the knowledge that can be gleaned from this visual representation, what is lost, and what can be gained from other methods.

I continue with a discussion of dimensionality reduction. I challenge D&G’s notion that all is lost in such a reduction and then consider various methods for achieving reduction. I briefly note the politics of data and reduction. I consider deep learning methods as a way of continually showing change where information from previous generations informs the next one. 

Next, I consider the notion that ATP itself is a rhizome. I consider how its status as closed system interacts with the open system that is its connections— how the dimensions of time and space manipulate their meanings. With the examples of the internet and ATP now fleshed out, I consider the prospect of creating protocols that generalize knowledge and signify both visually and textually. What would it mean for this post itself to be rhizomatic? That it can be negotiated non-linearly? I conclude with a list of references and provide source material when possible (definitely a breach of copyright law - can see them all [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sqcp8cy6wyqpcjh/AADNMp_5haQBLpWzk025u-k0a?dl=0)). 

Idea of beginninglessness can feel very much like disorganization. Does willful disorganization have a *table of contents*?

Interestingness rather than axiomatic correctness.
Notion that philosophy is based on axioms rather than X

In other words, I am playing fast and loose. Breadth rather than depth. While I have a laundry list of references, this is not a rigorous academic paper. The easiest way to justify this decision is that this paper doesn’t exist in a vacuum- it’s just a starting point.  I’m essentialist or misinterpreting but in many ways that is what I consider an important take away from the. Unapologetic aside is not beside the point— maybe it is the point? That I can’t create something that’ll exist in a vacuum. Ephemeral in its own ways— I need to renew the domain, I need to keep references updated and online, github needs X. But I am putting things in order.

Deadlines are the ultimate motivator:
Either I don’t sleep and pray that my research is thorough enough for sense to shine through near unconsciousness.
I see it as a challenge: the lack of rigor is not a cop out, but an application of rhizomatic thought. I, of course, do not believe this. I would like to explain myself and my ideas as well as I can. Alas, such a totalizing mission is doomed before it began so I must now focus on scope. I jump right into the idea that the internet is rhizomatic, that the rhizome isn’t such a radical development, and points for further research.
Or I half-tackle it all and my grand . All of winterim is for revisions

Where to begin in philosophy has always rightly been a delicate issue 

Question of how to begin 

Tentative conclusion that while beginning is important, there isn't one

Essentializing (though hopefully not misrepresenting) several nuanced arguments

Everything intertwingled and ultimately a part of the same conversation

One or multiple and unity 

Radical inteconnectedness

Directly linked? Probably not 

Everything is connected 

All a part of the same discussion - what is the discussion about?

Being, becoming, searching for truth 

Strongly argue in favor of an online version of A Thousand Plateaus in which _. How am I supposed to know where to look? If all of philosophy are increasingly layered levels of commentary, how can I trace them back? How can learn what a trace is? “Anything worth knowing can be explained simply”, but so much nuance when you get to such simple questions as the nature of being

I spend more time than is necessary on setting up the problem. 

Dualism that turns out not to be a dualism.

Instead, outline a system and approaches to the system. All from the impulse of “I wish I could visualize that!”

How much detail is too much detail? I abstract the idea— I assume the answer already exists and point you towards that source with the hopes that you come to the same conclusion as I do. That’s a lot of work! 

I sent it to a bunch of my friends so as far as audience is concerned, I want it to be basic enough that a somewhat interested friend can get the gist of what I’m saying where I’m still saying enough to remain interesting

For example, the same thing but for different people
Very easy to have different versions- thought it might be prudent to have one rife with copyright infringement and the other without
but everyone can do as they like with what I have down
if you understand what makes a rhizome different from a tree or root, skip those sections
if you don’t care about deep learning, that’s fine

Goal MIGHT BE to show that we should hyperliteralize the concept of the rhizome because we can do things with it on that level, but limited 

Plugging this into an assemblage 

Writing has nothing to do with signifying: surveying, mapping, even realms that are yet to come

Filtering on criteria

Anexact terminology 

The rhizome as a root that doesn't know which way is up

Only to remind you that it doesn't matter which way is up- it's all relative to a fixed point anyway. The grass is up when you're doing a headstand 

English seminar so perhaps scholarly and rigorous. Actually the opposite - a willful break from the grammar of academia in favor of ideas. If I'm to add to scholarship, it won't be through axioms 
Began with a deceptively simple question "what would a rhizome look like?" Down the rabbit hole of viewing the concepts on their own level
