Structure seems to be the overarching theme of *A Thousand Plateaus*. It is a book rife with geological and botanical metaphors, a book that seeks to explain how space and relations within this space works. It is a book of constant motion and instability. It is a book they claim is a rhizome with 'plateaus' in place of chapters. "Each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau." (22) Further, their rhizome "has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle (*milieu*) from which it grows and which it overspills". (21) While they admit "it's not easy to see things in the middle, rather than looking down on them from above or up at them from below, or from left to right or right to left". Rhizomatic writing is not written from a sedentary view: they assemble heterogeneity and lack a fundamental unity. Thus, the question of where to begin seems strikingly lacking for nomadic writing. What can be our foundation if we begin *in media res*?

(Add in more notes about the start)

Perhaps the start is never the beginning-- how can we tackle the issue of presuppositions? In *Difference and Repetition*, Deleuze argues that most of philosophy was founded on the notion of common sense as *cogitatio natura universalis* (good will of the thinker and good nature of thought). He calls this thinking the 'pre-philosophical image of thought' because it fails to question the nature of thought and being. This particular image of thought implies that "thought has an affinity with the true; it formally possesses the true and materially wants the true. It is in terms of this image that everybody knows and is presumed to know what it means to think." This Image, according to Deleuze, "prejudges everything" and thus can be called a "dogmatic, orthodox or moral image". In questioning the absoluteness of morality, Deleuze concludes that the conditions of a philosophy which would be without any kind of presuppositions are such: instead of being supported by the moral Image of thought, it would take as its point of departure a radical critique of this Image and the 'postulates' it implies. It would find its difference or its true beginning, not in an agreement with the pre-philosophical Image but in a rigorous struggle against this Image, which it would denounce as non-philosophical. As a result, it would discover its authentic repetition in a thought without Image." (page 131)

I really hope this is enough motivation to keep reading!

Twelve years later, however, it appears that thought *can* have an image that is not pre-philosophical. And it is the notion that philosophy begins with the rhizome.

While it appears that the rhizome is our beginning, I must set the stage with a discussion of botany. As Christy Wampole illustrates in *Rootedness*, botanical metaphors--especially those of the tree and root--have long been used to efficiently say what is otherwise extremely difficult or even impossible to communicate. Further motivating the importance of botanical terminology, Wapole notes critical theory's reintroduction of the idea that "thought itself is botanical in nature and that humans should look toward plants as a model for dwelling in the world, because they provide an alternate paradigm for the treatment of space, time, consumption, and death." {% sidenote side1 Wampole, [*Rootedness*](#wampole), 4-5. %}

I now, as Deleuze and Guattari do in the introduction to *A Thousand Plateaus* describe the three major botanical figures: the [Tree](#the-tree), [the Root](#the-radicle-system-or-fascicular-root), and the [Rhizome](#the-rhizome). But before I do, want a brief aside about the metaphor.


Dronsfield, Jonathan. Deleuze and the Image of Thought

The freedom and spontaneity of the accord in judgement does not however signify the presence of an innate tendency or unifying principle but rather the absence of a determinate interest or concept: the “absence of presuppositions” that Deleuze had noted in his work on the image of thought as the criterion of truly beginning in philosophy. Deleuze opposes the genetic approach to thought to the discourse of the conditions of knowledge

Rhizomatic Writing and Pedagogy 192
The interpellation of the academic with authentic voice is indicative of becoming between rhizomatic and arborescent, self and other, student and educator, and the plane of immanence and the plane of organization. Although my paper can be read in a linear fashion with the footnotes at the end, I also encourage my reader to include them. I have taken heed of the words from Gergoriou (2004), a Deleuzian scholar: "The goal is not to represent the rhizome but to implant it in thought. The effect they [Deleuze and Guattari] are after is not the understanding of the rhizome but a functioning, a whole apparatus that connects disparate, linguistic and non-linguistic things" (p. 240

, Gregoriou rightly explained that the rhizome must be rescued from its "literary over-coding in a pedagogical discourse as a metaphor for excessive multiplicity and radical openness. The rhizome must be made" (2004, p. 246, emphasis in origin



1987 definition of a rhizome
The rhizome multiple must be made ... a rhizome as subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radicles. Bulbs and tubers are rhizomes. . . Rats are rhizomes.
Burrows are too, in all of their functions of shelters, supply,
movement, evasion, and breakout. The rhizome itself assumes
very diverse forms, from ramified surface extension in all directions to concretion into bulbs and tubers. When rats
swarm over each other. The rhizome includes the best and the
worst: potato and couchgrass, or the weed. (

Fashionable nonsense
While critics call it an abuse of scientific jargon
“one sees that there is a great concentration of scientific terms, employed out of context and without any apparent logic, at least if one attributes to these terms their usual scientific meanings. To be sure, Deleuze and Guattari are free to use these terms in other senses: science has no monopoly on the use of words like “chaos”, “limit” or “energy”. But, as we shall show, their writings are crammed also with highly technical terms that are not used outside of specialized scientific discourses, and for which they provide no alternative definition.
These texts touch on a great variety of subjects: Gödel’s theorem, the theory of transfinite cardinals, Riemannian geometry, quantum mechanics …198 But the allusions are so brief and superficial that a reader who is not already an expert in these subjects will be unable to learn anything concrete. And a specialist reader will find their statements most often meaningless, or sometimes acceptable but banal and confused.
We are well aware that Deleuze and Guattari’s subject is philosophy, not the popularization of science. But what philosophical function can be fulfilled by this avalanche of ill-digested scientific (and pseudo-scientific) jargon? In our opinion, the most plausible explanation is that these authors possess a vast but very superficial erudition, which they put on display in their writings.”
