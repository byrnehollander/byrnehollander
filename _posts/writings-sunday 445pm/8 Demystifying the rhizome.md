Wampole 216ish: “D&G retrained in their writing on the rhizome some of the mystical features of writers like Claudel, Heidegger, and Weil” – demystify 
Hyperliteralizing
When you hyperliteralize the rhizome, you lost all metaphor (of a certain kind) in exchange for a different kind of abstraction
- Supposed to be useful, after all; how is a rhizome different from a recommendation engine; a consideration of where to go next
- Application beyond the internet
Wampole 222: “penchant for mysticism” – by replacing argument with a flurry of pictures, they imagine they’ll change minds, since the human is such a visual creature. We no longer choose and commit to one picture; we accumulate in shuffle them
- Multiple simultaneously but constantly shifting—the idea of “time slices”
Wampole 223: “In the end, the rhizome is not radically different from the root. It is still an embedded form, its pace of growth is the same, and it represents yet another instance of thinking botanically about thought.”
- Rhizome as nonbinary, nonhierarchical epistemology
- “Thinking takes place in the ground” – would it help us for computers to do this thinking? There’s a rhizome in every tree, after all
Celebration of multiplicity, of dissolved categories, of the horizontalization of all aspects of life
- No reason to not place things on a continuum in computational analysis
Limitations and deficiencies – a performance of self-doubt (page 224)
Wampole 227: “the rhizome’s vegetal matter does not last long enough to tell a tale and its surface is not dense enough to be inscribed with any lasting message. Any inscription on the rhizome would decompose along with it”
- How generations preemptively mark generations to come
- Very much in process but you can see what’s going on while processing is perpetually going on behind the scenes
- Could argue that I’m taking the forms too literally, but if they really are not metaphors, how else is one to take them?
Seeking the truth but unwittingly obfuscating through an endless series of speculative gesture. What truth can we find in n-dimensional reduction?
Rather than root on paper, expand it into a four-dimensional phenomenon, plastic and dynamic in time and space
- Paradoxical to capture a line of flight; the moment as multiple things pass into one each other at varying degrees
Wampole 231: rhizome still has “points of interest”, with lines intersecting to form meaningful junctions
- Is this not radical enough? How radical and abstract can we make the idea while it still being a useful tool? Does it matter if it's a useful tool?
- Building blocks of the rhizome described as molecules, atoms, particles, genes, and other microscopic units
Lines of flight describe the volatile vectors of the rhizome (page 232)
- Stochastic modelling? Chaos? Spurns stability and formal predictability
“Favoring production over reproduction, ‘a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model’ (12)” (233)
- Dichotomy between production and reproduction; can’t we have it both ways?
Becoming > Being
- If always passing from multiple becomings to multiple becomings, at what point do we simply call them beings?
