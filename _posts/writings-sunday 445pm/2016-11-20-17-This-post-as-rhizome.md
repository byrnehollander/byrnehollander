perhaps the most interesting part is the idea of collaborative website 
- github lets you create your own wikipedia
- people can “clone” the repository and make changes
- comments through github as well
- if they don’t get approved, still have their own version equally valid as mine
- Automatically generate glossary with context, hiding all the other content on the page

when intertwingularity is not in the protocol, but merely an afterthought, it becomes a long after thought.

I imagine it as concentric circles. The sources most pertinent followed by ones still referenced but engaged with less, other things I’ve read (time and space), and (in no particular order) everything I’ve read, everything I’ve thought, everything I’ve ever interacted with and the same for them. Can I say that the fact that I’m from Florida is less important than reading Difference and Repetition for understanding my argument? All factors in, but some things feel more intense. Mysticality - this unknowability


A focused stream of consciousness - the poetics and visual metaphors that ATP has, I approximate it 

As a millennial, clicking seems like less of a value judgment than turning somewhere and starting anew. I still “open in new tab” more often than click ‘back.’ The path of how I get there; the precision and reproducibility of the link. Can create a map of how I got to each place, what they were about, and how long i spent on each site
