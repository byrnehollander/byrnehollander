      <p class="pf">The vibrant afterlife of the rhizome, taken up across disciplines and across borders, seems to attest to its timeliness and relevance. For example, the Martinican philosopher and writer Edouard Glissant, in his books <i class="calibre1">Poétique de la relation</i> (1990) and <i class="calibre1">Philosophie de la relation</i> (2009) especially, elaborated the rhizome concept in his theories of Creolization, archipelagic thinking, <i class="calibre1">Relation</i>, <i class="calibre1">métissage</i>, the <i class="calibre1">chaos-monde</i>, and the new Caribbean iterations of baroque expression. Because of the French Caribbean’s complex political relationship <a id="p237" class="page1"></a>with France, the negotiation of identity there showed the shortcomings of the root metaphor, which was never as satisfying as it might have been for <i class="calibre1">un Français de souche</i> living in the <i class="calibre1">métropole</i>.<a id="fn522r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn522">45</a> Throughout the twentieth century, French Caribbean writers and intellectuals took on the project of tracing their roots, first in the 1930s and 1940s through the <i class="calibre1">Négritude</i> movement (which located their roots in Africa), then in the 1960s through the <i class="calibre1">Antillanité</i> movement (which located their roots in the Caribbean, in the specificities of each island), and in the late 1980s and 1990s through the <i class="calibre1">Créolité</i> movement, which claims a centerless, rhizomatic, pan-Atlantic network of relationships between the wide varieties of languages and cultures that find their home on the islands. Glissant writes, “Rhizomatic thought is the principle behind what I call the Poetics of Relation, in which each and every identity is extended through a relationship with the Other.”<a id="fn523r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn523">46</a> He recognizes the extent to which the rhizome metaphor conforms to the very habits of thought it seeks to subvert but argues that its value lies in its will to complicate and to open up the possibility of new relations. Glissant proceeds with a celebration of errantry and a critique of filiation and its conscious occultation of beginnings in order to preserve the Mystery. He is less prone to think in binaries than Deleuze and Guattari; he names binaries—for example, <i class="calibre1">nomadisme</i> and <i class="calibre1">sédentarité</i>—and then proceeds to show the great variety within each of these categories, a variety that demolishes the dichotomy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Cuban writer Antonio Benítez-Rojo has also adopted the vocabulary of Deleuze and Guattari in perhaps his best-known book, <i class="calibre1">The Repeating Island: The Caribbean and the Postmodern Perspective</i> (<i class="calibre1">La isla que se repite: El Caribe y la perspectiva postmoderna</i>), published in 1989. Benítez-Rojo replaces the terrestrial with the aquatic, arguing that in the Caribbean, water rather than earth is the necessary departure point for thought. This liquefaction of Deleuze and Guattari’s geophilosophy takes shape in Benítez-Rojo’s deployment of a natalist and vitalist language of the source, the womb, the mother, and water as the elixir of life. He is acutely aware of the terrestrial instability of the Caribbean, what he calls “the extremely complex and difficult architecture of secret routes, trenches, traps, caves, breathing holes, and underground <a id="p238" class="page1"></a>rivers that constitute the <i class="calibre1">rhizome</i> of the Caribbean psyche.”<a id="fn524r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn524">47</a> The Caribbean chaos-world, described so elegantly by Glissant, is equally present in Benítez-Rojo’s depiction of what goes on below the arborescent model described by Deleuze and Guattari. He writes, “Beneath the turbulences of <i class="calibre1">árbol, arbre</i>, tree, etc., there is an island that repeats itself until transforming into a meta-archipelago and reaching the most widely separated transhistorical frontiers of the globe” (24). In his trilingual repetition of “tree” and in pinning “etc.” to the end of the list, he gestures toward the total <i class="calibre1">mezcla</i> of culture and language, a primary characteristic of Caribbeanness, all the while destabilizing the arborescent model by showing that on the islands, culture never organized itself as a clean, bifurcating structure, the way European culture is often (erroneously) depicted. The archipelago is a productive node that disrupts time and space, undoing national boundaries and fusing various strands of time. He argues that “one of the most clearly and frequently seen regularities of the Caribbean novel is its reiteration of the theme that has come to be known as ‘the search for identity’ or ‘the search for roots’” (186). As I have shown throughout this book, the search for roots seems to be a universal problem. However, the nature of the search for roots in the Caribbean barely resembles the search for roots in, say, Europe. The story of how people ended up in each of these respective places differs too greatly.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Perhaps more important than their shared vocabulary of the rhizome, the chaotic, the baroque, and the archipelago is the emphasis by Glissant and Benítez-Rojo on the importance of the plantation in the formation of Caribbean culture. Deleuze and Guattari depict Westerners as root-seeking forest-dwellers and makers of fields, while Easterners are portrayed as restless occupants of the steppe and makers of gardens.<a id="fn525r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn525">48</a> Glissant and Benítez-Rojo focus on one particular kind of European field-making, the colonial plantation <a id="p239" class="page1"></a>machine, which is both a violent system and the painful birthplace of a hybridized, global future. What is a plantation? It is a highly organized system that forces the encounter between labor and vegetal life. It is the site of hierarchical power struggles, of botanical and human resource management, and of achieving economic success for one population at the back-breaking expense of another. Because, as I mentioned earlier, plant material is not the ideal surface for lasting inscription, the story of the plantation has largely gone untold. Glissant and Benítez-Rojo hope to change this by showing how the plantation has left its mark on every aspect of Caribbean culture and thought. In his chapter “Lieu clos, parole ouverte,” Glissant notes that the plantation system is what links the southern United States, the Caribbean, the Caribbean coast of Latin America, and northeastern Brazil. It is thus a place of Relation. Despite the great cultural differences that divide these regions, the plantation system creates a common structure and thus puts these seemingly disparate places in constant conversation. The pyramid structure of plantation power provided it a certain level of stability, and within its confines—Glissant has termed it a “lieu clos”—the plantation managed to become what he calls “one of the focal points where some of the contemporary modes of Relation were elaborated.”<a id="fn526r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn526">49</a> Although Glissant hesitates to explicitly define Relation, he gives hints of what it might mean. It is a system of connection. It is <i class="calibre1">not</i> totality. It is both an internal and an external movement that becomes an entirely new and unstable thing with each new element added to or taken away from it. It is the “limitless effort of the world” (“l’effort sans limites du monde” [186]), emptied of ideology and interested only in developing infinite points of contact between cultures. It links, relates, and relays. Despite the inhumanity of the plantation, “humanities” (79) managed to thrive there. This agricultural penitentiary created a proliferation of “stories, proverbs, sayings, songs” (82), because the oral tradition could not be stopped by the rolling acres of sugar cane. He argues that the neat and confident filiation presented in Alex Haley’s <i class="calibre1">Roots</i> does not correspond to “the talking genius of our lands” (“génie parlant de nos pays”), which is much hazier. In Caribbean genealogies, “our origins multiplied” (“nos souches se sont démultipliées” [86]). He calls the plantation “the second matrix” (87) after the slave ship, one that generated a shared literature, language, and music <a id="p240" class="page1"></a>between Bahia, Harlem, Jacmel, and Fort-de-France. In short, the plantation is a laboratory and one of the “wombs of the world” in which spatial closedness translates to cultural openness (89). The global encounter of cultures was tested first on a small scale in the Caribbean, making it a kind of archipelagic avant-garde. In Benítez-Rojo’s chapter “From the plantation to the Plantation,” he puts the problem in similar terms, insisting on the plantation as both a figurative and a nonfigurative phenomenon. He suggests that one should not begin to “read” the Caribbean through culture but rather through socioeconomic circumstances, and doing so leads him to the plantation as a starting point for his analysis. For him, the plantation “could serve as a telescope for observing the changes and continuities of the Caribbean galaxy through the lenses of multifold disciplines, namely, economics, history, sociology, political science, anthropology, ethnology, demography, as well as through innumerable practices, which range from the commercial to the military, from the religious to the literary.”<a id="fn527r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn527">50</a> This list resembles the list of disciplines that took up the rhizome as a central concept in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, suggesting that Benítez-Rojo has big ambitions for his notion of the plantation with a capital P, which he uses to distinguish actual individual plantations (small p) from “the society dominated by plantation economy” (317n8). He argues that if plantations had never been established, the populations of the islands would be “miniature replicas—at least in demographic and ethnological terms—of the European nations that colonized them” (39). Thus the plantation was the necessary precondition for the diverse chaos-world of the Caribbean and for the region’s “huge and heteroclitic archive” (313) of letters and traditions. The “three great paradigms of knowledge” that he explores in <i class="calibre1">The Repeating Island</i> are the People of the Sea, modernity, and postmodernity (314), and the plantation, both literal and figurative, is the primary site where the conjunction of all three occurs, often in bewildering ways. These various encounters in time and space have been described by people of the Caribbean as “syncretism, acculturation, transculturation, assimilation, deculturation, indigenization, creolization, cultural <i class="calibre1">mestizaje</i>, cultural <i class="calibre1">cimmaronaje</i>, cultural miscegenation, cultural resistance, etc.” (37), a fact that leads him to wonder how one can “be sure that a Caribbean culture even exists,” given the unmanageable heterogeneity that often causes language to fail. Benítez-Rojo proceeds by using the socioeconomic system of the plantation to read the literature of the Caribbean. One cannot disregard this system, he posits, because every word, every thought issues from it. His <a id="p241" class="page1"></a>conclusion: “The plantation turns out to be one of the principal instruments for studying the area, if not indeed the most important” (39). It is clear that in their appropriation of Deleuze and Guattari’s metaphor of the rhizome, Glissant and Benítez-Rojo have customized it for the islands. The closed system of the plantation made the Caribbean rhizome possible. In fact, the Caribbean was the only postmodern aspect of modernity. Without the cultural combinatorics that were part and parcel of plantation life, the islands would not have become the laboratory of the future. This kind of rhizomatic thinking takes the tragedy of plantation history and transforms it into a redemptive narrative, turning suffering into possibility. The suggestive concept of the rhizome seems to be fully customizable. The new proponents of vegetal democracy have certainly found use in its application.</p>
