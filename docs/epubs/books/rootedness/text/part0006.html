      <p class="pf"><a class="page1"></a>I would like thank all of my colleagues in the Department of French and Italian at Princeton University for their support throughout this project. In particular, David Bellos, Nick Nesbitt, Efthymia Rentzou, Göran Blix, Gaetana Marrone-Puglia, Florent Masse, Tom Trezise, and François Rigolot have made great efforts to mentor me as a rookie professor. I would also like to thank André Benhaïm, Marie-Hélène Huet, Natasha Lee, Volker Schröder, Katie Chenoweth, Simone Marchesi, Pietro Frassica, Christine Sagnier, Fiorenza Weinapple, Murielle Perrier, Sara Teardo, Rachel Hart, Topher Davis, and Christophe Litwin, as well as all of the graduate students and lecturers and everyone else in the department for being fantastic colleagues. I’d like to extend a warm thanks as well to the administrative staff, including Ronnie Pardo, RuthAnne Lavis, Kathy Varra, Kathleen Allen, Crystal Arrington, Mike Rivera, and Sam Evans. They make coming to work a real joy. I’d also like to thank Sarah Kay for her guidance before my arrival at Princeton.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">I have met so many wonderful, supportive friends and colleagues outside my department and at other institutions, and I want to thank them as well. Many attended the work-in-progress lecture where I presented this book in its embryonic stage; they provided extremely helpful input as it came into being. Others read my pages later or were simply there for me when I needed advice or a good conversation. I’d especially like to thank the following people for their support: Jill Dolan, Gerald Prince, Jack Woods, Maurie Samuels, Russ Leo, Tom Kavanagh, Emily Apter, Rava da Silveira, Emmanuel Bourbouhakis, Gabriella Nouzeilles, John Logan, Nigel Smith, Eduardo Cadava, Hannah Freed-Thall, Dora Zhang, Barbara Vinken, Howard Bloch, Anselm <a id="pxii" class="page1"></a>Haverkamp, Tom Harrison, Florian Klinger, Morgane Cadieu, Alice Christensen, Mareike Stoll, Peter Brooks, Eileen Reeves, Nikolaus Wegmann, Arnaud Perret, Yue Zhuo, Moussa Sow, April Alliston, Carol Jacobs, Jeanette Patterson, Sarah Chihaya, Nefin Dinç, Jessica Devos, Scott Francis, Stefano Ercolino, Daniel Heller-Roazen, Jeff Dolven, Michael Hoyer, Barbara Nagel, Susan Stewart, Tom Connolly, Rubén Gallo, Henry Sussman, Dan Hoffman-Schwartz, Rüdiger Campe, Dan Edelstein, Dylan Montanari, Carol Rigolot, Mary Harper, and Devin Fore. Thanks also to Caley Horan; without her unwavering friendship, the ride would have been a bumpy one.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">I wrote most of this book in the Irving S. Gilmore Music Library at Yale University during my sabbatical year there. I’d like to thank the librarians and the friendly security and café staff there, particularly Kenny, Mike, and Frank, who were witnesses to my long hours and who always had a kind word of encouragement after an exhausting day. Also, I’d like to give a special thanks to the Department of French and Italian and the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages at Stanford University, the French departments at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, and the Yale German department.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the fall of 2014, I taught a seminar cross-listed in the French and German departments at Princeton entitled “Roots in Twentieth-Century France and Germany,” which was based on all of the research I’d accumulated for this book. I want to give a very special thanks to the students who participated in this seminar, namely, Austin Gengos, Adeline Heck, Assimakis Kattis, Andrew Nelson, Liana Pshevorska, Alex Raiffe, and Marie Sanquer. The dynamic in the class was almost familial, and I am honored that the students participated so enthusiastically in the course. I don’t recall any other class that inspired me quite the way this one did. I want to thank Natalie Berkman as well, who took the time during her year abroad in Paris to dig in the Bibliothèque Nationale for me.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Without the guidance of Alan Thomas at the University of Chicago Press, this book would never have reached the public. I appreciate his tireless efforts in walking me through the publication process and his careful attention to my pages. I also want to express my gratitude to Randy Petilos, who helped put the finishing touches on the manuscript.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This project would not exist without the inspiration of Robert Pogue Harrison, my adviser at Stanford, who has since become my friend. If I were asked to trace my intellectual lineage, it would always lead back to him. Anyone familiar with his work will be able to identify my book as a very Harrisonian project. I’d like to thank him for his warmth and care for the duration of my project and long before. He read many drafts of my chapters with careful attention and had <a id="pxiii" class="page1"></a>priceless advice to offer. Our shared affinity for all things botanical resides in each page of this book.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There are several women who have mentored me and helped me to get where I’ve gotten in my personal and professional endeavors. These include my great-grandmothers, my grandmothers, and my mother, who have all been strong role models throughout my life; my high school French teacher Dede Hart; my undergraduate French professor Isabelle DeMarte; and Samia Kassab-Charfi of the Université de Tunis, whom I met at Stanford. I’d like to give an extra warm thanks to Marielle Macé, whose work has been very motivating for my own and whose kindness as an interlocutor is unparalleled.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">I give a warm thanks to my family, who have supported me despite my incorrigible nomadism. And several dear friends—Steffen, Ulrich, Christophe, Monika, and Hannes—have kept life special during the process of writing this first book. I thank Karen and Marc in particular for existing; a world without them would be an impoverished one. There are two people who carry me on their shoulders, with love, with enthusiasm, and with the deepest affection. Beth, my best friend and the most generous person I know, has watched this book grow into what it has become. I thank her for her love and care and feel lucky every day that I have her in my life. And I thank Florian, the person who made things crystal clear, for the great and small gestures and the immense tenderness implicit in them all.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And, if it is permitted to thank a place, I thank my hometown of Kennedale, Texas. The pasture behind my grandma’s house, the house where she was born and where she still lives, is the only place I can imagine as the ground of my symbolic roots.</p>
