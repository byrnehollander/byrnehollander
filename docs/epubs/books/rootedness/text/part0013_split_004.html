      <p class="pf">Derrida has been regarded by many as a sort of trickster figure, interested mostly in puns and language games rather than in a more legitimate and serious engagement with the texts he studies.<a id="fn449r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn449">80</a> In analyzing Derridean applications of etymology, it is useful here to reiterate the distinction between word history and word play. As we have seen, Derek Attridge puts Vico and Heidegger in the camp of authenticity-seeking etymologizers, while he considers Plato and Derrida to be etymologizers who let their “ironies play freely through their writing.”<a id="fn450r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn450">81</a> Of deconstruction’s linguistic play, Emily Apter writes: “Through diacritical invention, language was defamiliarized. Neologisms and syntactic intercessions broke up patterns of impacted, predictable meaning. The separation of prefixes and suffixes from verbal <i class="calibre1">racines</i> released lost or forgotten significations into the imagination.”<a id="fn451r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn451">82</a> Derrida was clearly on a mission. Because his texts resist interpretation and comment, I will limit my discussion of them to a survey of the instances in which rootedness surfaces as a pressing problem, and which, I argue, contain in a compressed form the entirety of his thought. An appraisal of his corpus makes it clear that the problems of origin, ground, root, foundation, source, and genealogy were perhaps his key intellectual preoccupations for the length of his writing life.<a id="fn452r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn452">83</a> His scrutiny of the problem<a id="p204" class="page1"></a>of writing is an apt departure point, since it was this theme that dominated his first public interventions. He sought to show—first through theory, then through practice—how Western philosophy has taken for granted the role of writing, which assumes itself as a given, the medium through which philosophical thought is necessarily communicated. In <i class="calibre1">Of Grammatology</i>, Derrida posits that our “philosophical conceptuality” is “entirely commanded by a situation determined by the relationships between logos and writing.”<a id="fn453r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn453">84</a> He makes an effort to force philosophers to acknowledge that their arguments are largely metaphorical in nature and that this metaphorization is simultaneously self-justifying and self-veiling.<a id="fn454r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn454">85</a> In a signature deconstructive move, Derrida uses metaphor—“sediment,” “entangle in their roots”—to emphasize the same metaphorizing philosophy he critiques. His conclusion here—that “this abyss of metaphor will never cease to stratify itself”—is followed by a lifelong performance and an endless cycle of texts that seem to feed on themselves. In the context of pre–May 1968 Paris, it is easy to imagine the kind of resistance such ideas would encounter, particularly at his home institution, built on the very foundations he sought to topple. In a cautionary introduction to Derridean vocabulary, Simon Morgan Wortham emphasizes the difficulty in <a id="p205" class="page1"></a>approaching Derrida’s philosophy as authoritative.<a id="fn455r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn455">86</a> To consider it a ground upon which to make claims or to gain some broad understanding of Western civilization is a risk. Derrida defines himself in opposition to two figures—Heidegger and Husserl, the roots of his own philosophical patrilineage—to whom he feels indebted and against whom he simultaneously launches his insurgence. While they took as their task a regrounding of metaphysics, their “son,” in mutinous fashion, sought instead to uproot everything, even philosophy itself. At times, Derrida is explicit in his critique of the root metaphor in all its forms and its hegemony over Western thought, writing that the root as a figure for origin is most often in truth “a concealment of the origin.”<a id="fn456r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn456">87</a> Launching a critique of the system as a whole rather than of a particular movement or school of thought, he uses the three heraldic texts published in 1967 to make clear that a such a critique requires a virtual barricade of text, a triptych, each piece of which echoes and sustains the others, offering to the public in one barrage something to talk about and a fresh vocabulary in which to do so.<a id="fn457r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn457">88</a> It is fitting that the problem of origin is central in these debut publications; at the moment of his own initiation into public philosophy, he begins with the beginning. In <i class="calibre1">Of Grammatology</i>, Derrida poses the question, “What is a lineage in the order of discourse and text?,” raising the implicit objection to a genealogical <a id="p206" class="page1"></a>depiction within a text or intertextually, but then he immediately forecloses the possibility of an answer with what he sees as an incontrovertible fact: “We know that the metaphor that would describe the genealogy of text correctly is still <i class="calibre1">forbidden</i>” (101). He continues, leaning once again—this time more heavily—on the metaphor of the root:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">If a text always gives itself a certain representation of its own roots, those roots live only by that representation, by never touching the soil, so to speak. Which undoubtedly destroys their <i class="calibre1">radical essence</i>, but not the necessity of their <i class="calibre1">racinating function</i>. To say that one always interweaves roots endlessly, bending them to send down roots among the roots, to pass through the same points again, to redouble old adherences, to circulate among their differences, to coil around themselves or to be enveloped one in the other, to say that a text is never anything but a <i class="calibre1">system of roots</i>, is undoubtedly to contradict at once the concept of system and the pattern of the root. But in order not to be pure appearance, this contradiction takes on the meaning of a contradiction, and receives its “illogicality,” only through being thought within a finite configuration—the history of metaphysics—and caught within a root system which does not end there and which as yet has no name. (101–2)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">The racinating function of a text and its role as the point of stability in a discourse, the ostensibly unchangeable and written truth that anchors generations who cannot communicate with one another face to face, has yet to be acknowledged, he argues. That this function exists, goes unnoticed, perpetuates certain ideas about the codependency of thought and writing, and transmits itself from generation to generation without anyone bothering to ask why is an aggravating problem for Derrida. Regarding any text, but particularly those that try to articulate a “genealogical representation,” he insists on the necessary copresence of several periods inside it.<a id="fn458r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn458">89</a> The invisible, self-involving strata of the text pretend to relieve us of the work of starting from the beginning with each new line of thought, but this work left undone means that the writer unwittingly allows the text to prohibit a critique of the Text as a concept. In <i class="calibre1">Writing and Difference</i>, which accentuates problems of origin, genealogy, and <a id="p207" class="page1"></a>rootedness, Derrida calls writing “the passion of the origin.”<a id="fn459r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn459">90</a> In addition to the rootedness of philosophy in <i class="calibre1">logos</i> and writing, the Derridean vocabulary—composed of terms like <i class="calibre1">trace</i>, <i class="calibre1">ghost</i>, <i class="calibre1">archi-writing</i>, <i class="calibre1">paleonym</i>, and <i class="calibre1">khôra</i>, all of which function frequently as synonyms for “root”<a id="fn460r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn460">91</a>—calls attention to the innumerable ways the past imposes itself on the present. The image of cinders or ashes (<i class="calibre1">cendres</i>), to which Derrida dedicated an entire book,<a id="fn461r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn461">92</a> makes its way from Foucault’s <i class="calibre1">History of Madness</i> as the “charred root of meaning” (“la racine calcinée du sens”)<a id="fn462r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn462">93</a> into Derrida’s “Cogito et histoire de la folie”<a id="fn463r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn463">94</a> (an article about Foucault’s text), into his <i class="calibre1">Circumfession</i>, and finally into his collaboration with Geoffrey Bennington called <i class="calibre1">Derrida</i>.<a id="fn464r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn464">95</a> Simon Wortham writes, “For <a id="p208" class="page1"></a>Derrida, . . . the cinder—leaving nothing, finally, to reveal or unveil—names the absolute non-memory which burns at the origin of language.”<a id="fn465r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn465">96</a> Finally, in his botanically titled <i class="calibre1">Dissemination</i> (1972), Derrida pursues these same origin-related problems using a more textually experimental writing practice. In his introduction, he begins with the problem of paleonymy, the summoning up of old names in new circumstances, writing self-consciously about the form in which his text will present itself.<a id="fn466r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn466">97</a> Again, the problem of linguistic indebtedness arises. Why must old names stay? How long must the past be given credit, renewed, recycled, appeased? The problem seems to arise from the conflict mentioned earlier between diachronic and synchronic considerations of language. If language is taken out of time—such an extraction would be a merely virtual exercise—how are we to think of ourselves in relation to these words?<a id="fn467r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn467">98</a> Why does old consistently mean better, more authentic, more pure? Here, Derrida’s position aligns well with that of Paulhan. Those who aim to legitimate etymology are unwilling or unable to acknowledge the nonrational motivations of their appeal to word roots. The titular concept of Derrida’s book is dissemination, which “endlessly opens up a <i class="calibre1">snag</i> in writing that can no longer be mended, a spot where neither meaning, however plural, nor <i class="calibre1">any form of presence</i> can pin/pen down [<i class="calibre1">agrapher</i>] the trace” (26). It is a dis-semination, an undoing or a disruption of the “semination” at work in all texts. In the preface, or “hors-livre,” he calls a preface a <i class="calibre1">seed</i> that casts a paternal shadow over the entire text.<a id="fn468r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn468">99</a> The language of psychoanalysis imposes itself here, with the <a id="p209" class="page1"></a>archetypes of father and son hovering in a closed sexual loop. The purpose of Derrida’s emphasis on this redefinition of dissemination, not as a spreading of seed but as a de-seeding, is to illustrate a method for calling into question all inherited assumptions about the written word. Dissemination, like deconstruction, seeks to uproot old names and old words, to unseat and unseed the father.<a id="fn469r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn469">100</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">His texts, with their noncommittal and evasive techniques of endless deferral, have left many readers throughout the decades unsatisfied, if not utterly indignant. He has been called an ironist, a charlatan, an irresponsible thinker, and countless other names by some, and celebrated as a saint and savior of philosophy by others. One has to wonder why his texts produced so much simultaneous and extreme anxiety and praise. If his ideas were ridiculous, why were they not simply ignored? What is so appealing or repulsive about Derrida’s ideas to newer generations of scholars who have arrived long after the first heat of those early debates in the late 1960s had time to cool? Because Derrida was very much a product of the phallogocentric system he critiques,<a id="fn470r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn470">101</a> we could borrow an image Bachelard uses in his chapter “Roots” as an appropriate metaphor for Derrida’s oeuvre: it is the root that uproots.<a id="fn471r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn471">102</a> Whereas his philosophical “fathers” Heidegger and Husserl sought to “reroot” philosophy, Derrida sought to uproot it altogether. The appeal for some, particularly those disenfranchised by phallogocentric thinking, is Derrida’s critique <a id="p210" class="page1"></a>of a certain kind of conservatism, conservatism in the sense of the will to preserve tradition. As I have shown throughout the preceding chapters, a belief in the redemptive power of roots is nearly always motivated by conservatism, be it genetic, cultural, intellectual, or political. So in the case of this young philosopher who arrives, publishes three books in one year, each of them making bold claims about the grounds on which the institutions that trained him are built, one can see why nearly everyone in the academy suddenly became a conservative in light of his claims and felt compelled to respond to his provocation. Many of those scholars sanctioned by the institution were insulted, while many looking in from the outside were delighted. It was no longer this or that school of philosophy that could be accused of conservatism, but philosophy itself. Given his success in the United States, one could take this as another instance of the younger nation trying to defy and define itself in opposition to Old Europe, where the distant roots of American philosophy were deeply embedded. Derrida, this sower of discord, divided the academy in America and in Europe, causing scholars to ask one another in hushed tones, “Are you a Derridean?,” the very adjective incendiary enough to launch hours-long debates involving high personal stakes. After its peak (in the 1970s or 1980s, depending on variable criteria), his legacy has become an uncertain one, which would certainly please him, since undecidability was among his favorite themes. Whether one reads his texts as literature, as philosophy, or as a combination of both, his impact on all fields of the humanities is irrefutable. He succeeded in changing the conversation.</p>
