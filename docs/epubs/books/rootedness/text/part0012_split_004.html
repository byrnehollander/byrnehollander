What have you done with your humanism? Where is your dignity?” (213). Pascal’s original use of the term in context is this: “Man is but a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed. It is not necessary that the entire universe arm itself to crush him. A breath of air, a drop of water, suffices to kill him. But were the universe to crush him, man would still be more noble than that which kills him, because he knows that he dies; and the universe knows nothing of the advantage it has over him. Our whole dignity consists, then, in thought. . . . this is the principle of ethics.” Pascal, <i class="calibre1">Thoughts</i>, 170.</p>

If you go too far you come up against the vegetation belt. Vegetation has crawled for miles toward the cities. It is waiting. Once the city is dead, the vegetation will cover it, will climb over the stones, grip them, search them, make them burst with its long black pincers; it will blind the holes and let its green paws hang over everything. You must stay in the cities as long as they are alive, you must never penetrate alone this great mass of hair waiting at the gates; you must let it undulate and crack all by itself. In the cities, if you know how to take care of yourself, and choose the times when all the beasts are sleeping in their holes and digesting, behind the heaps of organic debris, you rarely come across anything more than minerals, the least frightening of all existants.

          <p class="sl"><a id="fn339" class="page1" href="part0012_split_002.html#fn339r">28</a> It is perhaps worth noting that Sartre’s original proposed title for his autobiography was <i class="calibre1">Jean sans terre</i> (literally, “John without land”), a reference to John, king of England (1166–1216), whose nickname was “John Lackland,” a name given to him by his father to reflect the fact that he would not inherit any significant amount of property. That Sartre would choose a landless and thus unrooted figure for the title of his own autobiography is significant. When Simone de Beauvoir asked him what this title meant, he replied, “<i class="calibre1">Sans terre</i> meant without inheritance, without possessions. It meant what I was.” Sartre quoted in Beauvoir, <i class="calibre1">Adieux</i>, 213. In his journal, Sartre wrote, “I’ve tried to destroy plenty of old ideologies, but my concern was to build. I may have lacked ‘roots,’ but I’ve never lacked stability.” Sartre, <i class="calibre1">War Diaries</i>, 175.</p>

          <p class="slt1">Ibid., 22</p>
          <p class="fnp">In his notebooks, Sartre pursued a similar line of thought:</p>
          <div class="blockquote">
            <p class="ntbqs">We may say, for instance, that perception of <i class="calibre1">that</i> tree is above all an existential phenomenon: to perceive the tree, for consciousness, is to surpass the tree towards its own nothingness of tree. One must not, of course, see in the word “surpassing” [<i class="calibre1">dépassement</i>] any indication of an <i class="calibre1">act</i>. It is merely a mode of existing. Consciousness exists for-itself beyond that tree as what <i class="calibre1">is not</i> that tree; the nihilating connection between reflection and the reflected ensures that consciousness can be for itself only by reflecting itself as being, precisely, nothingness of the world <i class="calibre1">where</i> there is that tree. Which means it is non-thetic consciousness of itself as thetic consciousness <i class="calibre1">of</i> that tree; the tree is the transcendent theme of its nihilation.</p>

The root is already half assimilated into the earth which nourishes it; it is a living concretion of the earth; it can utilize the earth only by making itself earth; that is, but submitting itself, in a sense, to the matter which it wishes to utilize. Sliding, on the contrary, realizes a material unity in depth without penetrating farther than the surface; it is like the dreaded master who does not need to insist nor to raise his voice in order to be obeyed. An admirable picture of power. From this comes that famous advice: “Slide, mortals, don’t bear down!” This does not mean “Stay on the surface, don’t go deeply into things,” but on the contrary, “Realize syntheses in depth without compromising yourself.”</p>

            <p class="ntbqs">[German philosophy] wants to reconquer the Greek plane of immanence, the unknown earth that it now feels as its own <i class="calibre1">barbarism</i>, its own <i class="calibre1">anarchy</i> abandoned to the <i class="calibre1">nomads</i> since the disappearance of the Greeks. It must also constantly clear and consolidate this ground, that is to say, it must lay foundations. A mania for founding, for conquering, inspires this philosophy; what the Greeks possessed Autochthonously, German philosophy would have through conquest and foundation, so that it would make immanence immanent <i class="calibre1">to</i> something, to its own Act of philosophizing subjectivity (the cogito therefore takes on a different meaning since it conquers and lays down the ground).</p>

          <p class="sl"><a id="fn360" class="page1" href="part0012_split_003.html#fn360r">49</a> Philosophy can take root only in radical reflexion upon the meaning and possibility of its own scheme. . . . There lies embedded in its meaning as philosophy a radicalism in the matter of foundations, an absolute freedom from all presuppositions, a securing for itself an absolute basis: the totality of presuppositions that can be “taken for granted.” But that too must itself be first clarified through corresponding reflexions, and the absolutely binding quality of its requirements laid bare. That these reflexions become more and more interwoven as thought advances, and lead eventually to a whole science, to a science of Beginnings, a “first” philosophy; that all philosophical disciplines, the very foundations of all sciences whatsoever, spring from its matrix—all this must needs have remained implicit since the radicalism was lacking without which philosophy generally could not be, could not even make a start. The true philosophical beginning must have been irretrievably lost in beginning with presuppositions of a positive kind. Lacking as did the traditional schemes of philosophy the enthusiasm of a first beginning, they also lacked what is first and most important: a specifically philosophical groundwork acquired through original self-activity, and therewith that firmness of basis, that genuineness of root, which alone makes philosophy possible.</p>
