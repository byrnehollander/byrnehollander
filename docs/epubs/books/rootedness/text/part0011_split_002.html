      <p class="pf">Simone Weil’s legacy is an unstable one. She has been depicted as all of the following: Christian mystic, committed Marxist, Platonist, factory worker, intellectual genius, self-hating Jew, androgyne, unintentional feminist, anorexic, and madwoman. Much of the academic interest in her work arose posthumously with the publication of her unfinished reflections, such as <i class="calibre1">La pesanteur et la grâce</i> (<i class="calibre1">Gravity and Grace</i>), <i class="calibre1">L’enracinement</i> (<i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i>), and <i class="calibre1">Attente de Dieu</i> (<i class="calibre1">Waiting on God</i>). Her thought has been particularly well received in Italy, perhaps because of the compatibility between a certain kind of Italian Catholic thought and the specific orientation of her Christian mysticism. Many of her contemporaries found her to be an eccentric (in both the negative and positive connotations of the term) and an original thinker with an unconventional, highly self-invested approach to politics and religion. Her mythology has continued to grow, and her work today is appreciated by contemporary European and American audiences, particularly by those with an interest in feminism, Catholicism, and labor movements. Her totalizing diagnostic practice looked everywhere in culture past and present for the causes of the most pressing problems in her time. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of her biography is her refusal to describe culture from afar. She chose instead to embed herself in unfamiliar experiences. For example, once she took an interest in the daily experience of workers, she wasn’t content to draw conclusions from written testimonies or descriptions of factory life. She went to work in a Renault car factory herself. She also worked alongside the peasants in the vineyards in Saint-Marcel-d’Ardèche in southeastern France. She did not exempt herself from physical labor simply because she was a trained intellectual. The depth and breadth of her knowledge and the variety of experiences she’d <a id="p128" class="page1"></a>acquired by the time of her death at age thirty-four are immense by today’s standards. She was fluent in Greek by age twelve and later learned Sanskrit and studied religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. She had a panoramic understanding of European and world history and was accomplished in mathematics and philosophy. She briefly joined a French-speaking anarchist militia on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Leafing through Weil’s notebooks, one finds mathematical equations with prayers and reflections on God in between, connections between lived experience and intellectual life, etymological analyses, quotations in Greek, aphorisms, excerpts from poems, lists of philosophical questions, and reflections on almost every discipline (biology, physics, mathematics, political theory, etc.). Richard H. Bell describes Weil’s corpus this way: “The ‘primeval chaos’ of Simone Weil’s world is the world of Greek poetry and tragedy and Greek philosophy; it is the world of St. John of the Cross and Meister Eckhart; it is the world of a radically incarnational Christology without dogma; it is a world of Descartes, Kant, Racine, Alain, and René Le Senne; it is the world of the <i class="calibre1">Bhagavad-Gita</i>, Taoism, and Zen Buddhism; it is a world of folklore and mythology.”<a id="fn253r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn253">41</a> Perhaps contemporary readers are drawn to this variety of sources and experiences that informed her work, coupled with the absolute urgency of voice with which she expresses her religious, philosophical, and political ideas. This same urgency is repellent to other readers who hear in her voice evidence of madness and an unyielding, perhaps autocratic character. Weil’s emotional disposition was perceived as being at odds with the intellect and was thus unappealing to many among her scholarly contemporaries.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">I want to make the claim that Weil’s fear of rootlessness can be attributed to her general fear of abstraction. Rootedness for her meant to turn one’s full attention toward a concrete, spiritually infused world, participating actively to sustain the past, present, and future of a community, and to nourish one’s environment in order to strengthen the moral, intellectual, and spiritual aspects of life. Conversely, to be rootless is to face a set of circumstances in which things are replaced by figures of those things. The world was becoming rootless owing to the simple fact that “the relation of the sign to the thing signified [was] being destroyed.”<a id="fn254r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn254">42</a> Unlike the extraction-fearing majority of thinkers presented so far in this study, who fear being plucked from their contexts, Weil’s most explicit fear was abstraction, illustrated in her antipathy toward money, algebra, <i class="calibre1">machinisme</i>, and the conversion of labor into abstract value. <a id="p129" class="page1"></a>Despite his immateriality, God was no abstraction for Weil; she sensed his presence bodily and considered the earth a manifestation of his grace. She judged the Enlightenment as a progression toward cold and hard reason, so far removed from the warmth of Christian love that she lauded time and again in her writings. It is fair to say that Weil anticipated Gianni Vattimo’s notion of weak thought (<i class="calibre1">il pensiero debole</i>), not simply as an abstract concept but as her lived approach to the world through God.<a id="fn255r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn255">43</a> As an intellectual, she felt ill at ease remaining in the walled-off world of academic political and economic theory; her dread of abstraction sent her into the factories and fields to work alongside the laborers who remained alien to many intellectual Marxists. As she read the news of the war from England, she prevented it from becoming an abstraction by constraining herself to the same rations as the French soldiers. <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> is a particularly strong example of this antipathy toward abstraction, as it shows a thinker who wants to help her compatriots undo the alienation of the modern age by guiding them toward a kind of self-grafting into vocation, education, faith, country, and the land. It is too reductive to say that Weil simply feared modernity as such. It was rather the tendency of capitalism, intellectualism, and bureaucracy to multiply abstractions that disquieted her. I imagine that cyberwarfare and electronic trading would have terrified Weil much more than a drone.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Weil can be described as a vertical, symmetrical thinker. Aside from her attraction to the vertical sacred of Christianity, she believed heavily in the necessity of symbolic hierarchies as a vital need of the soul. In her view, the natural order of things involves a vertically polar structure of superior and inferior. However, she also considers equality a necessity of the human soul, arguing that the worker is not less than his supervisor, simply different from him. Both are necessary. She claims that in exchange for the privilege of supervising others, the supervisor takes a greater risk in maintaining this position and is more accountable if his workers have grievances against him. Conversely, the worker, whose vocational risk is inherently smaller, should suffer less when his supervisor has grievances against him. The entirety of Weil’s thought advocates the maintenance or recovery of equilibrium. For every right, there is a <a id="p130" class="page1"></a>responsibility. For every sin, there is a corresponding punishment. The root, then, as the mirror image of the branches, fits neatly into her symmetrical and vertical notion of justice. Unlike Gide’s immanent <i class="calibre1">nourritures terrestres</i>, Weil’s <i class="calibre1">nourritures</i> are purely transcendental.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the early 1940s, Weil, who was working as an editor at France Libre in London, drafted an ethical guide for the French people, a document that would reorient the nation after the failures leading up to the war. The resulting treatise was never completed but was published posthumously under this title given by the editors: <i class="calibre1">L’enracinement: Prélude à une déclaration des devoirs envers l’être humain</i> (<i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties toward Mankind</i>). The text elicited highly varied reactions, including praise, ambivalence, and scorn. Albert Camus considered it one of the most important books to have appeared after the war.<a id="fn256r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn256">44</a> In a review, Georges Bataille noted that the ideas put forth in <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> would be virtually impossible to execute,<a id="fn257r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn257">45</a> but he conceded that the zeal and passion of Weil’s work was compelling enough to captivate the reader.<a id="fn258r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn258">46</a> Maurice Blanchot, in his essay “Affirmation (desire, affliction),” paints an ambivalent portrait of the contradictions <a id="p131" class="page1"></a>and stubborn certitude in Weil’s thought.<a id="fn259r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn259">47</a> Conor Cruise O’Brien, an Irish politician, wrote of <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> in the early 1980s: “The atmosphere she evokes is that of a state governed by a spiritual and moral elite, a rule of the saints. . . . This is the rather discouraging outcome of a hypothetical effort to apply in politics the thinking of a writer who was essentially nonpolitical, and even antipolitical.”<a id="fn260r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn260">48</a> His reaction sums up the paradox of Weil’s late work, namely that she continued to write heavily political texts during perhaps the most politically agitated moment in twentieth-century European history, even after her purported renunciation of politics in favor of spiritual thought. For this reason, her solutions to Europe’s problems are of a quasi-metaphysical nature and thus nearly impossible to implement in any practical way. The spirit of these texts, however, was meant to galvanize Europeans to abandon their course for a new one, perhaps most strongly through <i class="calibre1">pathos</i>. <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> could be described, then, as an inspirational text, but not a pragmatically executable one. Unlike Denise Levertov’s skepticism seen in <a class="page1" href="part0009_split_000.html#ch02">chapter 2</a> regarding the human’s rerooting of itself in the environment, Weil’s utopianism leads her to believe that, with some spiritual guidance, Europe could be restored. She set out to provide this guidance herself. But in this respect, Weil encounters the same problem as Marxism in general, that is, the difficulty of translating theory into action.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Her sweeping diagnosis in <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> attributes nearly every societal predicament to what she calls <i class="calibre1">déracinement</i>, or uprootedness. The root metaphor merges verticality, symmetricality, and the nutritive aspect of the sacred, a key component of Weil’s Christian poetics. Many of the fragments in her notebooks focus on the conjugation of the botanical and the human.<a id="fn261r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn261">49</a> Her botanical sympathies lead unsurprisingly to the conclusion that a new rootedness is the only way for the European to reintegrate into God’s world. The need to address a loss of roots in Europe derives from her belief that the condition is pathological and transmissible, capable of infecting every person <a id="p132" class="page1"></a>and every aspect of life. She establishes this general principle: “Whoever is uprooted himself uproots others. Whoever is rooted himself doesn’t uproot others.”<a id="fn262r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn262">50</a> A common trope in Weil’s corpus is that of bridging or approximating, in the sense of bringing closer together. As David McLellan writes, “<i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> is about the preservation of the <i class="calibre1">metaxus</i> as bridges leading to the supernatural.”<a id="fn263r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn263">51</a> Abstraction resists the bridging reflex since it involves a drawing away from (<i class="calibre1">ab</i> + <i class="calibre1">trahere</i>); thus it is a phenomenon of distancing. She pictured the world becoming ever more remote from itself, replacing the real with empty figures. To restore the broken bonds between the Chthonic and the Uranic, between people and their livelihoods, she promotes the spiritualization of work, the regrounding of education, and the ownership of property, thus clearing away the distracting mediations that hold the person at a distance from God’s world. In her conception, the severing of roots is a figure for the unchecked multiplication of intervening distractions from truth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Ultimately, her key recommendation for reestablishing them relies on the imperative that these broken synapses in the human soul must be rewired through physical labor and its spiritual benefits. Weil’s obvious pedagogical intent and her professed belief in certain principles of pedagogy (the importance of repetition, the meaningful association of physical gestures and corresponding thoughts or words) manifest themselves particularly in the passages on labor and education. Suffering from a general feeling of uprootedness not only while in the factory but also at home, in political parties, in unions, in places of leisure, and in an intellectual milieu, the alienated worker has come to feel ashamed of his vocation. As a solution, Weil proposes a progressive spiritualization of bodily gestures, particularly those involved in one’s vocation. Ann Pirruccello calls these Weil’s “somatic practices” and notes their proximity to some aspects of Buddhist meditation.<a id="fn264r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn264">52</a> Weil evokes the image of a peasant farmer who, as he tends his fields, preserves in the back of his mind the biblical references to the seed in order to associate a spiritual reflex with the physical gestures of his labor. One’s vocation can be schematized into a series of repetitive motions, particularly in the case of factory workers or farmers, who must perform the same motions again and again to survive. She explains that the youth aiming to become laborers in factories or other urban settings <a id="p133" class="page1"></a>could use mechanics as their organizing analogy, while youth aiming for farming or other rural labor jobs could be trained primarily through analogies of the cycles of the natural world. She literalizes the notion of rootedness by advocating property ownership for both urban workers and rural peasants. In her view, a sense of rootedness can be had only through the possession of land, through its tending and care, and through the pleasure procured when the fruits of one’s labor have been harvested. By extending and fusing the self with one’s material environment, the human imitates the root’s purposeful possession of its environment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Regarding education, Weil claims that young people come of age as cultural orphans with no stable heritage to ground them. They lack a comprehensive education that emphasizes the cultural contributions of the Greeks. The education system fails students in another way: it draws no connections between taught material and the real world. Geometry, for example, is presented as an abstract discipline with no consequences in everyday life. She points to the absurdity of an educational system that privileges rote memorization over contextualization, in which children can brainlessly quote astronomical theories but never bother to look up at the sky.<a id="fn265r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn265">53</a> Knowledge acquired through formalized schooling has become an abstract exercise devoid of material relevance. She also embeds a critique of the colonial endeavor in her grievances against French education, namely that schooling should address the specificities of a given culture. For the French to indoctrinate the children in their colonies with a mistaken cultural heritage, intentionally or as mere oversight, underscores the nation’s ignorance about the universal human need for cultural rootedness. Such ignorance makes it impossible for anyone living under France’s colonial rule to develop a sense of cultural belonging, and the result has nefarious consequences for the <i class="calibre1">métropole</i>. Weil expands her educational critique to include the problem of class, claiming that anyone not born into a middle-class, intellectual milieu is automatically excluded from any kind of intellectual engagement. Peasants and workers are alienated by the exclusive vocabulary and uninviting atmosphere of higher education. By failing to “translate” into <a id="p134" class="page1"></a>a language that is comprehensible to workers and peasants the important concepts from philosophy, literature, and other disciplines, the intellectual class has precluded the civic engagement of a sizable proportion of the total population. A celebration of local folklore has the potential to “help the peasants feel at home again in human thought” (87).<a id="fn266r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn266">54</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">In her assault on abstraction, she pursues a very old idea, found already in the New Testament, in the first epistle of Saint Paul to Timothy: <i class="calibre1">Radix omnium malorum cupiditas</i>, “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” She blames it in part for both world wars and for the progressive root loss of the European people. In <i class="calibre1">Gravity and Grace</i> (<i class="calibre1">La pesanteur et la grâce</i>, written in the early 1940s and published posthumously in 1947), she writes that money, alongside algebra and <i class="calibre1">machinisme</i> (the mechanization of the means of production), is one of the three forces responsible for civilization’s unraveling. In this aspect of her social criticism, we see a clear link between Christianity and Marxism, both wary of money as a force of moral corruption and as a tool of control. For very different reasons and with very different strategies, these two utopian ideologies urge their adherents to deal cautiously with the human-made danger of money. It is clear that Weil deploys both Christian and Marxist rhetoric to make her case against coveting it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What I believe to be Marx’s most interesting statements about money, and, probably not coincidentally, the most literary, are found in an early manuscript called “The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society,” from 1844. In this text, Marx invokes Goethe’s <i class="calibre1">Faust</i> and Shakespeare’s <i class="calibre1">Timon of Athens</i> to argue that money has a magical power of reversing nature, allowing the rich man to make his what he does not naturally possess. Goethe’s Mephistopheles says:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Six stallions, say, I can afford,</p>
        <p class="sl">Is not their strength my property?</p>
        <p class="sl">I tear along, a sporting lord,</p>
        <p class="sl">As if their legs belonged to me.<a id="fn267r" class="fnref1" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn267">55</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon"><a id="p135" class="page1"></a>He then quotes Shakespeare’s Timon, who claims that “yellow, glittering, precious” gold has the power to “make black white, foul fair, wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.”<a id="fn268r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn268">56</a> From these two literary examples, Marx goes on to expound on his claim that money has the power to reverse nature. He writes: “I <i class="calibre1">am</i> ugly, but I can buy for myself the most <i class="calibre1">beautiful</i> of women. Therefore I am not <i class="calibre1">ugly</i>, for the effect of <i class="calibre1">ugliness</i>—its deterrent power—is nullified by money. I, as an individual, am <i class="calibre1">lame</i>, but money furnishes me with twenty-four feet. Therefore I am not lame. I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honored, and hence its possessor.” He proceeds to call money “the universal <i class="calibre1">agent of separation</i> as well as the <i class="calibre1">true binding agent</i>,” because everyone is subject to its network, but its influence is one of estrangement and rupture. Money distorts, confounds, and overturns “all human and natural qualities” (167). It converts impossibilities into possibilities. Here, he adds to the equation the issue of imagination; money essentially converts the “<i class="calibre1">image into reality</i> and <i class="calibre1">reality into a mere image</i>” (168). Money is creative in the sense that it forges new realities that could not exist without it, but the foundations of these new realities are purely fictional. Weil’s critique of money focused on its status as a product of the imagination. She shares with Marx a semiotic understanding of money as an inverter of signs. Her claim that “the relation of the sign to the thing signified is being destroyed” by money is consistent with Marx’s distress over the wealthy bourgeois man who could buy all of the qualities he didn’t possess naturally, reversing nature and thus corrupting an entire system of signs.<a id="fn269r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn269">57</a> In Weil’s framework, “the game of exchanges between signs is being multiplied of itself and for itself. And the increasing complication demands that there should be signs for signs” (139). The world becomes profoundly less readable under such conditions.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It may seem clear why she would find a problem with money and mechanization, but why would she be opposed to algebra? What bothers her is the very difference that separates algebra from arithmetic, namely that algebra relies on abstractions, such as letters that stand in for certain variable values. She preferred geometry to algebra, because its forms had an obvious connection to the concrete world. Algebra separates the human from reality by turning thought into a series of abstract operations with no immediately visible bearing on the physical world. She claims that both algebra and money are “levellers” and that “vertical distances are not represented in them.”<a id="fn270r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn270">58</a> Given her obsession <a id="p136" class="page1"></a>with the vertical sacred, this leveling force that makes false equivalencies and corrupts the relation between signified and signifier could do nothing but destroy roots.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Weil dedicates a portion of <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> to the national specificities that led to Europe’s crisis. She describes the easy capitulation of France to Germany as a passive symptom of uprootedness, while Germany’s own violent conduct was an aggressive version of the same affliction.<a id="fn271r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn271">59</a> Weil goes on to criticize France for its institutionalization of prostitution, its shameful treatment of foreigners, and its colonial greediness. She argues that France may have to choose “between her attachment to her Empire and the need to have a soul of her own again” (167). One of her more scathing criticisms of France involves its nostalgic attachment to the Roman heritage of conquest and “grandeur in the style of Corneille” (175). This celebration of the wrong values, which closely resembles Germany’s cult of the hero, is largely responsible for France’s attempts to expand its territories and propagate its global cultural influence. She fears that the similarities between German hero worship and French imperial fetishism point toward France’s imminent mimicry of the National Socialist power play, already discernible in the Vichy Regime and its self-aggrandizing rhetoric. In support of a new kind of patriotism, she argues that the suitable attitude toward one’s country is not one of heroic grandeur but of simple compassion or pity. Looking toward Christ and Joan of Arc as models,<a id="fn272r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn272">60</a> Weil argues that Christian humility helps citizens behave toward their nation with the same care, tenderness, and warmth as they would toward their own children or toward their aging parents. In opposition to this kind of love, she saw the Enlightenment value of “liberty without supernatural love” as “something purely empty, a mere abstraction, without the slightest possibility of ever becoming real.”<a id="fn273r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn273">61</a> In general, she saw the French as dupes and claimed that “the love Frenchmen have for abstract logic makes it very easy for them to be deceived <a id="p137" class="page1"></a>by labels.”<a id="fn274r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn274">62</a> She disapproved of the Encyclopédistes’ elusive quest for progress, which had filtered into contemporary France and “killed any chance of inspiration being sought in a revolutionary tradition.” She considered the lot of them to be “rootless intellectuals” (110). Barrès, in his <i class="calibre1">Les déracinés</i>, also describes the fear of intellectualism as a fear of abstraction.<a id="fn275r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn275">63</a> Abstract reason divorces people from the material world and leads them into a relativizing logic through which conclusions can be made without reference to the concrete world. Yet, while Barrès binds this fear of abstraction to a larger nationalist argument, Weil is much less concerned with administrative borders or even cultural specificity. She is interested in universal <i class="calibre1">enracinement</i>, caring more about the fate of the world than about France’s destiny.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We find in Weil’s metaphorization of the root an anxiety about the transformation of her culture into a culture of abstraction. This nuance is essential and distinguishes Weil from most of the authors presented thus far. Her root-seeking is not nationalist, regionalist, or environmental. Her arguments do not correspond cleanly to the political and ecological discourses of earlier chapters. Even her Christianity is of a very different nature than Claudel’s, for example. Weil was a walking exception to almost every rule imaginable. Her root metaphor, too, is exceptional. Through it, one is able to think of the world along a different spectrum, with the concrete at one end and the abstract at the other. Undeniably, the world relies far more on abstractions now than even in Weil’s time. The general sense of alienation that accompanies digital living, capitalist abstraction, and the market logic of the new university might be most aligned with Weil’s sense of alienation, definitely more than with Heidegger’s. A decade after the war’s end, he proposed a solution to another kind of European crisis through the metaphor of groundedness (<i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>). While the philosophies of Weil and Heidegger have rarely been put in conversation, they contain significant, overlapping features relevant to the problem of European rootedness in the first half of the twentieth century.<a id="fn276r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn276">64</a> Still, in this juxtaposition, we come to understand that even while seemingly in dialogue, they are having very different conversations.</p>
