      <p class="pf">Martin Heidegger was a <i class="calibre1">terroiriste</i>. His philosophical bioregionalism closely resembles the notion of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, a specifically French term that has no translation in English, German, Spanish, Italian, or many other languages. Thomas Parker defines terroir as “the soil, climate, and physiographic composition of a certain locale. It is a singularly French notion explaining how geographic origin influences its agricultural produce, imbuing food and wines with specific flavors.”<a id="fn277r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn277">65</a> In the same vein as the environmental determinism of Montesquieu and Rousseau,<a id="fn278r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn278">66</a> <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> brings the abstract notion of character to the world of agriculture. One might expect to find the metaphor of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> in Weil’s texts; after all, she did work in the vineyards in Saint-Marcel-d’Ardèche, which might have made her more likely to think in terms of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> and the relationship between <i class="calibre1">nourriture terrestre</i> and <i class="calibre1">nourriture spirituelle</i>. However, it is in Heidegger’s work that the idea recurs in various guises. In his corpus, land shapes the temperaments of the people who inhabit it, and every poem or thought that an individual produces ideally contains in its essence the residue of a specific <a id="p139" class="page1"></a>locale. <i class="calibre1">Terroir</i> turns land into an abstract idea. This puts Heidegger’s rootedness at odds with that of Weil.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Heidegger, the <i class="calibre1">philosophe campagnard</i>, is perhaps best known for his lasting influence on poststructuralist thought, for his affiliation with the National Socialists, and for his inclination toward rural life, symbolized by his legendary Black Forest hut in Todtnauberg.<a id="fn279r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn279">67</a> His mixed legacy was stirred again recently upon the publication of the <i class="calibre1">Schwarze Hefte</i> (<i class="calibre1">The Black Notebooks</i>), which include flagrantly anti-Semitic passages, casting a shadow over what was left of his reputation among his contemporary proponents. Much of his postwar thought responded to the crisis of late modernity and called for Europeans to reground themselves to avoid the nefarious effects of new technologies. Charles Bambach argues that Heidegger’s careful construction of his own sylvan myth began in the radio address “Creative Landscape: Why Do We Remain in the Provinces?” (“Schöpferische Landschaft: Warum bleiben wir in der Provinz?,” broadcast in 1933 and published in 1934) and continued through his well-known essay “On the Origin of the Work of Art” (“Der Ursprung des Kunstwerkes,” [1935]), his 1949 essay “Feldweg,” and his 1950 book <i class="calibre1">Holzwege</i>, up to his <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i> address. One could add to this list “On the Essence of Ground” (“Vom Wesen des Grundes” [1929]), an early iteration of his notion of groundedness. Heidegger opts most often for the term <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>, which translates alternately as rootedness, groundedness, or autochthony, instead of <i class="calibre1">Verwurzelung</i>, the German equivalent of Simone Weil’s term <i class="calibre1">enracinement</i>.<a id="fn280r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn280">68</a> The <i class="calibre1">topos</i> of groundedness can be found already in some of his earliest writings and is pervasive in his texts between 1933 and <a id="p140" class="page1"></a>1945, during his affiliation with National Socialism. Jeff Malpas has dedicated an entire book to Heidegger’s treatment of place, arguing that this omnipresent theme in his work often takes form in a wide range of topological terms, such as <i class="calibre1">Ort</i> (place), <i class="calibre1">Ortschaft</i> (locality)<i class="calibre1">, Stätte</i> (site, location, place)<i class="calibre1">, Gegend</i> (region, area, district)<i class="calibre1">, Dasein</i>, and <i class="calibre1">Lichtung</i> (clearing). He argues that Heidegger should be considered a founder of “place-oriented thinking” and divides his treatment of place into three categories,<a id="fn281r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn281">69</a> “as the proper <i class="calibre1">focus</i> of thinking,” “as that which is the proper <i class="calibre1">horizon</i> of thinking,” and “as that which is the proper <i class="calibre1">origin</i> of thinking” (13). This last category is of most interest when considering the problem of Heidegger’s <i class="calibre1">terroirisme</i>,<a id="fn282r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn282">70</a> given that in his view, thought and all forms of cultural production emanate from the land and are marked by it. Robert Mugerauer has noted the pervasive theme of homecoming present in Heidegger’s late texts, to which he attributes a very specific vocabulary, including <i class="calibre1">Heim</i> and <i class="calibre1">Heimat</i>, homelessness, dwelling, site, place, <i class="calibre1">Geheimnis</i> (mystery or secret), <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i> (groundedness), and <i class="calibre1">Bodenlosigkeit</i> (groundlessness).<a id="fn283r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn283">71</a> Recalling Bachelard’s taxonomy of images of repose, the home and the root are first and foremost figures of return. Of Heidegger’s concept of <i class="calibre1">Dasein</i>, George Steiner writes that Being is necessarily situated in the real world, claiming that “to be human is to be immersed, implanted, rooted in the earth, in the quotidian matter-of-factness of the world (‘human’ has in it <i class="calibre1">humus</i>, the Latin for ‘earth’).”<a id="fn284r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn284">72</a> But Heidegger’s is not an <i class="calibre1">irgendwo</i> or “just anywhere” embeddedness, which leads us to the first distinction between him and Weil. Weil’s is a rootedness of generality; Heidegger’s is a rootedness of specificity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He delivered a memorial address called “Gelassenheit” (Releasement) on October 30, 1955, in his home village of Meßkirch on the occasion of the 175th birthday of the local composer Conradin Kreutzer. Charles Bambach argues that in this address, he was attempting to distance himself from the National <a id="p141" class="page1"></a>Socialist tropes of his earlier writing.<a id="fn285r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn285">73</a> While the audience may have expected the illustrious philosopher to discuss Kreutzer or music in general, they received instead an hour-long address about possible responses to technology in the atomic age. He connects this theme to Kreutzer by first broaching the subject of the composer’s geographic origins, shared by Heidegger himself, located there in the south of the Baden-Württemberg state in Germany.<a id="fn286r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn286">74</a> He poses a rhetorical question to his audience, to which he already has an answer: “Does not the flourishing of any genuine work depend upon its roots in a native soil?”<a id="fn287r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn287">75</a> Heidegger’s hypothetical question is a clear reference to Friedrich Schleiermacher’s claims about the rootedness of a work of art in its place of origin. Schleiermacher wrote in the early nineteenth century: “Hence a work of art . . . is really rooted in its own soil, its own environment. It loses its meaning when it is wrenched from this environment and enters into general circulation; it is like something that has been saved from the fire but still bears the burn marks upon it.”<a id="fn288r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn288">76</a> To bolster his affirmative response to this question, Heidegger quotes Johann Peter Hebel, a writer who spent much of his life in Baden as well: “We are plants which—whether we like to admit it to ourselves or not—must with our roots rise out of the earth in order to bloom in the ether and to bear fruit.”<a id="fn289r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn289">77</a> Hebel clearly echoes Plato’s <i class="calibre1">Timaeus</i>, although the human here is rooted in the earth but rises to the ether, or the heavens, and transcendence means the bearing of fruit, ostensibly the fruit of creativity and poetic production. The address then goes on to lament the fact that after the war, many Germans fled, and those who remained were figuratively displaced through television and radio. He ascribes this detachment from the <i class="calibre1">Heimat</i> to a general state of rootlessness throughout the country and as a general condition of modernity. Heidegger’s reactionary technophobia is evident throughout the text; however, what is unique here is his attempt to formulate a <a id="p142" class="page1"></a>healthy response to technology, one that will provide the conditions for a new groundedness without rejecting technology altogether. He begins an interpretation of Hebel’s words:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqf">The poet means to say: For a truly joyous and salutary human work to flourish, man must be able to mount from the depth of his home ground up into the ether. Ether here means the free air of the high heavens, the open realm of the free spirit.</p>
        <p class="bql">We grow more thoughtful and ask: does this claim of Johann Peter Hebel hold today? Does man still dwell calmly between heaven and earth? Does a meditative spirit still reign over the land? Is there still a life-giving homeland in whose ground man may stand rooted, that is, be autochthonic? (47–48)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Again, in Heidegger’s reading of Hebel, we find that the path to the heavens is contingent upon rootedness, this time in regionally specific soil. If one loses this capacity to infuse one’s work of art or even one’s life with evidence of its regional specificity, one’s origins are severed and transcendence through art is no longer possible. What he describes here is a notion similar to the French <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, the term used in winemaking and other kinds of agriculture to identify the specific characteristics of flavor and aroma imparted to the product by local conditions such as soil, climate, and water supply, which differ greatly from one field to the next in some regions.<a id="fn290r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn290">78</a> While acidity, color, sugar content, and other attributes of a particular bottle of wine are certainly altered by the land and its weather, the conceptual resonance of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> echoes far beyond chemistry. The vintner knows it is a transcendental celebration of regional specificity. The word isn’t always positively connoted; <i class="calibre1">sentir le terroir</i> means to embody either the qualities or the flaws of regional flavor.<a id="fn291r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn291">79</a> The negative meaning expresses a tension between city and country, between cosmopolitanism and provincialism, in which people from the country see themselves as more authentic than those from the towns, and the urbanized see the rurals as ill-bred and culturally backward or belated. The idea of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> has gained cultural capital in recent years, particularly in France, as producers of locally <a id="p143" class="page1"></a>grown agricultural products have sought better ways to compete against large-scale manufacturers of heavily processed foods. To describe the disconnection between people and their food, Olivier Assouly has proposed the term <i class="calibre1">déracinement alimentaire</i>, the uprootedness from gastronomic traditions of their region, people’s lack of knowledge about the food they eat, and the inability to cook.<a id="fn292r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn292">80</a> Relying on a nostalgia for pastoral life, the local producers have attempted to claim that their products are more authentic than factory-processed food, which is tainted with preservatives, artificial colors, and flavor enhancers. Their products, they argue, are more <i class="calibre1">real</i>. What these local producers claim about food, Heidegger claimed about art. Only land can provide the stamp of authenticity on vegetables and verses.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As Matt Kramer has argued, “[<i class="calibre1">Terroir</i>] sanctions what cannot be measured, yet still located and savored. <i class="calibre1">Terroir</i> prospects for differences. In this it is at odds with science, which demands proof by replication rather than in a shining uniqueness.”<a id="fn293r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn293">81</a> Heidegger is a difference-seeker, but in the realm of “what cannot be measured.” The ineffable qualities that distinguish the home-grown from the counterfeit are very effective tools for making an unlosable argument. Similar to Heidegger’s evocation of imagined etymologies in order to reinforce a particular claim, the logic of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> asks the recipient of his argument to trust him and his authenticity radar. He relies on a certain <i class="calibre1">je ne sais quoi</i> or a <i class="calibre1">soupçon</i> of something in a poem, something in the air, something in a glass of wine that others must simply believe that he perceives though they cannot. In contrast to Weil, he celebrates the abstract qualities of <i class="calibre1">Heimat</i>, perceptible only by a native son. The abstract is what helps him give credence to his claims: untraceable etymologies fashioned into vague evidence, local textures, and newly coined metaphysical concepts all mobilize abstraction for the purpose of reassurance. Less than the abstracting tendency of modernity, he feared uniformization; he needed to believe in the singularity of his experience. However, distinction translates easily into separate but unequal; despite Heidegger’s attraction to abstraction, Claudio Magris points out in his <i class="calibre1">Danubio</i> that the philosopher lacked the imagination to understand that the experiences of someone he’d never met were as authentic as his own.<a id="fn294r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn294">82</a> In his engagement with National <a id="p144" class="page1"></a>Socialism, Heidegger proved himself incapable of empathic projection. His <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> was the only legitimate <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>. Karl Jaspers, who denounced Heidegger’s affiliation with the Nazis, conceived of German guilt in terms of a rootedness in the “German spirit and soul,”<a id="fn295r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn295">83</a> into which a strong sentiment of coresponsibility could seep. Through the German cultural <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, the nation was reaping the seeds it had sown.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">More abstractly, <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> is a concept whose main purpose is to recontextualize. Not knowing where one’s wine comes from, not knowing the environmental conditions that made it possible, is to take the product but leave its context behind, constituting a kind of dumb consumption. <i class="calibre1">Terroir</i> is a recuperative notion that tries to tell a resituating story, the origin story of a wine or—in Hebel’s and Heidegger’s case—of a person. For example, the <i class="calibre1">Appellation d’origine contrôlée</i>, the French certification process with strict rules for identifying the origin and regulating the naming of agricultural products, finds its human equivalent in the issuing of birth certificates, going one step further in its insistence on a correspondence between name and place. The creation of a bureaucratic framework through which to regulate something as slippery as <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> is no easy task. When the concept is taken up by philosophy, it becomes even more dubious. Because of its approximative nature and quasi-spiritual implications, <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> proves very useful in Heidegger’s volatile argumentation. While Weil’s and Heidegger’s searches for context overlap in many ways, Weil does not rely on <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> to make her case. Her approach to recontextualization is more pragmatic and—strangely—less mystical than his. In this instance, Heidegger proves to be much more of a mystic than Weil.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Heidegger’s speech goes on to lament the loss of <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>, or groundedness, caused by the spirit of the age. While the term can be translated as “rootedness” or “autochthony,” the translation “groundedness” is preferable because the root <i class="calibre1">Boden</i> here means “ground” or “soil.” The term <i class="calibre1">Ständigkeit</i> alone may mean constancy, steadfastness, stability, or permanence; thus, attaching <i class="calibre1">Boden-</i> as a prefix implies terrestrial fixedness or sureness of earthly foundation. The adjective <i class="calibre1">bodenständig</i> is a part of everyday language in German, both in Heidegger’s time and now. It means down-to-earth or humble and is used to describe people. In a signature move, Heidegger attempts to <a id="p145" class="page1"></a>estrange the familiar by forcing his audience to approach the mundane word with fresh eyes, to notice the ground of which it is composed, and to literalize and transform it into a philosophical concept. He gives new attention to <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>, thus making it visible again and showing the extent to which the contemporary world lacks it. For Heidegger, the groundlessness of life in his time was a product of the very age itself, not of a particular behavior or laxity. More specifically, he refers to the incommensurability of the human with technology. He proposes a solution, what he calls <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i>, a term borrowed from the medieval theologian and mystic Meister Eckhart. The word had the earlier metaphysical connotation of giving oneself over to God, but Heidegger secularizes it.<a id="fn296r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn296">84</a> For him, <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i> involves a relaxing of the self when faced with any unfamiliar and potentially threatening phenomenon, a giving-oneself-over to the object at hand. This counterintuitive relaxation before the unknown offers, in his view, a way to rectify the harmful pattern he’d already identified in the preatomic age and to prevent its transmission to the nuclear future. He elaborates on the relationship between <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i> and <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>: “Releasement toward things and openness to the mystery give us a vision of a new autochthony which someday even might be fit to recapture the old and now rapidly disappearing autochthony in a changed form” (55). He ends with this hypothetical scenario, thus returning, if only obliquely, to the occasion for which the memorial address was presented: “If releasement toward things and openness to the mystery awaken within us, then we should arrive at a path that will lead to a new ground and foundation. In that ground the creativity which produces lasting works could strike new roots” (56–57). So <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i> and openness toward the mystery become for him a panacea not only for the anxieties about the uncertain atomic future but also for the perceived loss of regionally rooted creativity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One can discern in this strange memorial address Heidegger’s attempt to redefine the theme that had dominated so much of his earlier writing, that of local specificity, which, given the context in which that writing was produced, is inextricably bound to toxic nationalism. His celebration of the local involves an emphasis on the appreciation of all of the bioregional features of one’s homeland, which have an impact on culture. The earthiness of Heidegger’s project, from his fascination with <i class="calibre1">Holzwege</i> (paths made for seeking wood) and the <i class="calibre1">Feldweg</i> (field path) to the mystification of his Black Forest hut, shares with the French notion of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> an attachedness to one’s land of origin, a <a id="p146" class="page1"></a>rootedness not only to the land’s beauty and bounty but to its capacity to distinguish the authentic, local, and good from the inauthentic, foreign, and bad. One’s roots mark not only the work of art, but any type of thought, as he asserts in this declaration: “I am convinced that there is no essential work of the spirit that does not have its root in originary autochthony.”<a id="fn297r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn297">85</a> A national myth can easily be forged by binding <i class="calibre1">Volk</i> and <i class="calibre1">Boden</i>; any human-as-citizen can claim an attachment to the ground (national territory) on which the person dwelled since childhood.<a id="fn298r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn298">86</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Furthermore, the sacralization of one’s own dwelling space creates the conditions for a self-imposed custodianship of the plants, the water, the soil, and the creatures that dwell there. This is why so many scholars have framed Heidegger as an ecological philosopher. It is essential to recall that the twentieth-century ecological movement in Germany was originally bound to far-right politics. This right-wing German environmental preoccupation is clearly a pagan ecology. Unlike the United States and other European nations, where ecological interests were originally left-leaning, in Germany it was largely the National Socialists who advocated the stewardship of the land, which was seen as the embodiment in nature and the progenitor of the German <i class="calibre1">Geist</i>. Indeed, the paganistic obsession with the earth’s earthiness in whatever form seems to be a signature of Germanic culture.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Like Heidegger, Jung expressed his fear of human alienation from nature and tradition in the form of a critique against America, whose daily way of life he saw as, “in a subtle way, so <i class="calibre1">déraciné</i>, uprooted.”<a id="fn299r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn299">87</a> Europe’s fear of American modernity, so distant geographically and philosophically from the slow-simmering developments of the old country, takes form most often as a lament against the self-orphaning tendency of the United States. The dismissal or destruction of nature there and the alienating aspects of work and home life, <a id="p147" class="page1"></a>consumerism, and technological innovation were signs that these children of Europe wanted to deliberately cut themselves off from Mother Nature and the Fatherland. Jung saw in Europe’s adoption of “the American tempo” a sign that his own continent could not resist the tendency to self-eradicate at the same pace as the United States; he conceived it as “a final race between aging Europe and young America” (123). Nature gets caught in the crossfire of the worldwide competition for technological advancement, but, as Jung asserts, severing the tie with nature is a first step toward human exile. He claims that “natural life is the nourishing soil of the soul” (67),<a id="fn300r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn300">88</a> an image that transforms the soul into a plant.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Early in the twentieth century, the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner developed a school of thought known as anthroposophy, which involved the spiritual rerooting of the human in nature, work, education, family life, and all aspects of daily existence. Steiner was the founder of Waldorf Education, which has an international presence today, and his entire pedagogy relies on the root metaphor.<a id="fn301r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn301">89</a> From the plant, the child learns one of the central tenets of anthroposophy: that human life should take form as cosmic embeddedness.<a id="fn302r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn302">90</a> In endless comparisons between plants and humans, Steiner comes to the conclusion that humans are truly botanical beings.<a id="fn303r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn303">91</a> Unsurprisingly, he also <a id="p148" class="page1"></a>looked toward the Greeks as an influence,<a id="fn304r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn304">92</a> and he took interest in what he calls the “root races” of humanity in his book <i class="calibre1">Cosmic Memory: Prehistory of Earth and Man</i>. Unlike Heidegger’s nationalizing or regionalizing ontology, Steiner’s reflections on origin and terrestrial embeddedness resemble Simone Weil’s, focusing more on the holistic spiritual well-being of the individual than on any geographically specific autochthony. As shown in <a class="page1" href="part0009_split_000.html#ch02">chapter 2</a>, anthroposophists like the poet Christian Morgenstern took up Steiner’s metaphor of rootedness and essentially canonized it as one of the central tropes of the movement. The National Socialists denounced Steiner and his movement despite its obvious racializing undertones and its paganistic sacralization of nature. Steiner seemed to favor a postracial, postidentarian civilization in which race and nation would be absorbed into a universal connectedness. A clear genealogy can be traced through early Germanic paganism, its residue in the Middle Ages in legends like the mandrake story, the botanical obsessions of the German romantics, right-wing environmentalism, anthroposophy, and Heideggerian land worship.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In his text “Heidegger, Gagarin and Us,” Emmanuel Levinas describes Heidegger’s attachment to the earth as a form of infantile nostalgia and paganism.<a id="fn305r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn305">93</a> The dangerous pagan myth of earthly embeddedness appeals to the childish part of the self that resides in the mystery, experiencing it with total fascination. He believes that Judaism understood something that other religious cultures have not, namely that destruction of sacred groves symbolizes an elimination of the mystery that motivates humans to be cruel to one another.<a id="fn306r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn306">94</a> He addresses Heidegger’s technophobia, noting that technology is less dangerous in the end than the proponents of place because “place” is most often a divisive concept <a id="p149" class="page1"></a>that separates people into natives and foreigners. In his view, technology affords the opportunity to do away with the stubborn mysticism that represses the human. Levinas then addresses the stereotype that the city, the perceived locus of the modern Jew, is where humans lose their connection with nature. He traces a lineage between Socrates and the Jews, claiming that Socrates championed the city as the space of the social and understood that this human congregation was essential for thought. Levinas goes on to argue that Christianity and Judaism differ the most in their definition of the human’s relationship to the earth. The former nurtures “family, tribe and nation” while the latter “has freed Nature from its spell” (233–4). Maurice Blanchot shares this conviction, arguing that fixedness is a primary characteristic of paganism and that the Jew, who resists this immobility, is more prepared for the contingencies of life, which might force one to move at any moment. For him, “to be pagan is to be fixed, to plant oneself in the earth, as it were, to establish oneself through a pact with the permanence that authorizes sojourn and is certified by certainty in the land.”<a id="fn307r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn307">95</a> Judaism wants to break this pact and to do away with the geographic certainties. Levinas pursues this argument in his article “Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity” as well, claiming that the “earth-maternity determines the whole Western civilization of property, exploitation, political tyranny, and war.”<a id="fn308r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn308">96</a> The fact that pagans, the National Socialists, and Heidegger take embeddedness as the default and “natural” condition of the human is the most deleterious aspect of this worldview. Levinas’s claim becomes problematic in light of Zionist efforts to reroot Jews in a homeland; the tension in contemporary Judaism between a conscious celebration of nomadism as a chosen form of dwelling in the world and the celebration of a recovered nation shows that the view of Jews as “naturally” rootless people is extremely reductive.<a id="fn309r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn309">97</a> Levinas’s denunciation of Heidegger’s thought goes far beyond him as an individual; rather, he is a mere representative of a widespread worldview determined by the centrality of place in one’s personal mythology. As I show in <a class="page1" href="part0013_split_000.html#ch06">chapter 6</a>, what Levinas describes here constitutes what Stephen Pepper has <a id="p150" class="page1"></a>called a root metaphor or ground metaphor, that is, a basic metaphor, usually assumed early in life, that determines all other aspects of one’s worldview. For Heidegger, Levinas argues, the entirety of his philosophy departs from a basic false belief that home and land exert a quasi-mystical influence in the formation of person as a culture-producing subject.</p>

      <p class="pf">One finds many parallels between Europe’s situation today and that of Weil’s and Heidegger’s Europe. New technologies continue to provoke anxiety. Nuclear energy, drones, genetically engineered food, and surveillance technologies like facial recognition and metadata-collection software keep people on edge. There is particular concern over the progressive zombification of the human through rampant use of smartphones and other digital technologies that turn social interaction into a remote event. Europe has witnessed a resurgence of ultranationalism in places like Greece (Golden Dawn), France (Marine Le Pen and the new generation of the Front National), Germany (Pegida and the Nationalsozialistischer Untergrund), and Italy (Forza Nuova, Fiamma Tricolore). The increased intensity of Islamophobia has manifested itself in campaigns against the building of mosques, the wearing of the headscarf in public schools, and the implementation of Sharia Law on European soil. Furthermore, new political parties have emerged whose primary objective is to dismantle the European Union. The demands of capitalism and consumption culture have detrimentally impacted not only the environment but the dignity of the working class, whose jobs are constantly at risk, either for export owing to the lack of an international minimum wage or because mechanized means of production make human workers unnecessary. The university has become more a career-development hub than an institution for the development of critical minds and a well-rounded set of skills for living; the bureaucratization and commercialization of the university, more in the United States than in Europe, have created a student body more interested in crafting a flawless C.V. than in fully assimilating ideas and nurturing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of politics, history, aesthetics, and other fields. There is just enough comfort and distraction to keep the masses pacified and reliant on a steady stream of new needs, and thus to forestall an insurgence. How would Weil and Heidegger respond upon discovering that the problems they anticipated have impacted future generations to such a vast degree?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Scrutinizing Weil’s <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> reveals that her main interest seems to lie in the daily experience of working-class and rural people rather than the <a id="p151" class="page1"></a>promotion of one nationality, race, ethnicity, or creed over another. Greatest in numbers, the working class is the necessary foundation upon which a stable society must rely. Weil was cured of her undying patriotism for France at a young age, after the punitive effects of the Treaty of Versailles became apparent. She discovered that every nation, every people, every individual is fallible. While she does promote cultural continuity through the nurturing of traditions, she does not believe that the ancestors were infallible, either. As David McLellan writes, “[Weil] did not share Barrès’s worship of the earth and the dead and her conceptions of hierarchy and order were far from those of Maurras and the <i class="calibre1">Action Française</i>.”<a id="fn310r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn310">98</a> She was no cultural purist; her thought is the result of an active combinatoric practice, fusing a wide variety of influences and testing the possibilities and limits of each. She critically interrogated the influences on her thought. For example, she challenged many aspects of Leftist activism and Christianity even while espousing most Leftist or Christian tenets. While Weil undoubtedly approaches the question of rootedness from a French Catholic perspective, her vision involves a more widely applicable set of principles that anticipate many of the most pressing problems of <i class="calibre1">post</i>modernity. From vocational estrangement to total alienation from the natural environment, from the abysmal cleft between education and real life to abridged cultural memory, Weil specifically addressed, already in the 1930s and ‘40s, these problems that afflict us today. Despite her deployment of a mystically fervent vocabulary, the content of the better part of her recommendations is secular and devoid of racial or national implications. Several aspects of Weil’s understanding of rootedness are surprisingly relevant today. Though she explicitly addresses Europe, the same solutions for providing humans with a sense of belonging in the world could be equally relevant in China, Angola, or Ecuador. In the passages that get away from the specificity of Europe and address the estranging aspects of international modernity, or rather anational modernity, her prescriptions insinuate a borderless community of workers, farmers, teachers, and people of all vocations and ages; in short, she addresses citizens of the world. She uses France and Europe as case studies to illustrate a more general problem of human detachment provoked by the conditions of modernity. I believe Weil correctly identified the real cause of many of Europe’s woes in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Abstraction, not simply technology, is what could lead to a catastrophe of global magnitude.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In Heidegger’s case, the fear of estrangement from one’s surroundings owing to new technologies certainly resonates today, particularly in relation to the <a id="p152" class="page1"></a>Internet, digital telephony, and media infatuation. His description of a popular addiction to alienating devices could not be more applicable than to the now. The 1980s through the present have been marked by a fear of digital technology; the language of pathology (the virus, the worm), the language of warfare (spyware, Trojan horses), and other ominous terminologies (ransomware, rogue security software, the bug) to describe malevolent programming practices are indicative of this fear. The <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i> address promotes a moderate response to the new, encouraging people to subdue the fear reflex rather than staunchly refuse all technological innovations. As an individual, one cannot prevent the arrival of new technologies; one can only temper one’s response to them. Heidegger’s recommendations are relatively abstract and expressed through the quasi-mystical vocabulary of release in the style of Meister Eckhart. Such a vocabulary implies that the cold objectivity of Enlightenment reason is insufficient in responding to the new technological advancements for which it was in part responsible. The Enlightenment hoped to shine a glaring light on every dark corner of civilization. It hoped to expose the mystery. Heidegger seems to propose in his <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i> address a reenchantment of life and a nurturing and acceptance of the mystery without the need to lay it bare. By unstiffening one’s response to the unknown, one begins to move in the same inevitable direction as the flow of the new rather than resisting this current to no avail. This is not to say that Heidegger was suddenly a Zen master who had emptied himself of Self; he remained warily critical of the human’s relation to technology. Still, he recognized the futility of categorical refusal. Fear of the unknown takes other forms as well. For example, one could place the fear of a new technological device in the same category as the fear one feels toward a neighboring nation about which one knows very little. Heidegger recognized his own anxieties toward the new and foreign in general and their unknown consequences, as what is new or foreign is inherently <i class="calibre1">unursprünglich</i>, far from the origin, far from home. Opposing the impending danger of nuclear proliferation, Heidegger’s late iteration of <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i> takes as its implicit adversaries the United States and the USSR, allowing him to express fear of two overlapping unknowns simultaneously: the cultural influence of these world powers and the destructive technologies they wield. Fear of the alien neighbor brings Heidegger back to where he feels most at home: celebrating the knownness and knowability of his own region. Through the logic of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, Heidegger resists uniformization and makes the case for regional specificity. The weather, topography, and the qualities of the soil and water produce <i class="calibre1">difference</i> in plants and people that originate in a particular spot. To cut ties with these difference-imparting phenomena is to accept a future of sameness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><a id="p153" class="page1"></a>If Weil and Heidegger had been asked to take sides in the <i class="calibre1">Querelle du peuplier</i>, I feel confident that Heidegger would have sided with Barrès in his regionalist appeal, which borrows a <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>-like logic to prove that land leaves its mark on people. Celebrating the specificity and perfection of one’s place of origin usually demotes someone else’s homeland. The <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> logic rarely involves rankless specificity; its focus is qualitative difference. If you can imagine a conversation between Heidegger and Barrès about which is better, a small corner of the Black Forest or a small corner of Lorraine, the debate would certainly be contentious. This kind of exclusive particularism and the search for difference can create an atomized and volatile politics. As for Simone Weil, while she does share Barrès’s fear of intellectualism and abstract reason, I don’t believe she would have been particularly inspired by either his position or Gide’s. Her singular take on the question of rootedness does not line up neatly with the typical discourses of nation, race, nature, or religion. Her diagnosis of Europe’s problems is holistic, informed by a strong understanding of history, an amalgamated spirituality, and an obstinate belief that abstraction is at odds with human prosperity. If we were to embrace Heidegger’s call for a new <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>, we would be following the same logic of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, which has a difficult time acknowledging the mystical element behind it. The contemporary fetishization of locally produced food and wine represents he attempt to resist the corporate invasion of agriculture while still participating in the consumerist compulsion. To turn land into a mystical rootbed that infuses human cultural production with its magic seems in many ways a more exploitive idea than for a multinational food corporation to harm the environment in order to make a profit. When the homeland itself becomes a kind of exclusive brand with supernatural powers, of which everyone wants a piece, the political and social consequences can be devastating. Heidegger’s abstraction of the land into mystically infused <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, which cannot be quantified, participates in the very mechanism that Weil feared. At least she is open about the mystical elements in her thinking. Her plea for a new rootedness in an unspecified location—whose historical traditions should be learned, whose fauna and flora should be studied, and whose contours should be contemplated—asks everyone to embrace the place where he happens to be. Polynesian children should not be forced to recite “our ancestors the Gauls”;<a id="fn311r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn311">99</a> they should know about local traditions, spiritual practices, agriculture, and the necessity of their vocations. In her idealized conception, one culture should not be celebrated to the detriment of another. However, this utopianism is complicated by her <a id="p154" class="page1"></a>fear of abstraction, which led her to attribute the greatest cause of European rootlessness to capitalism, intellectualism, and Judaism. This sweeping verdict undermines the more powerful parts of her argument, which undoubtedly could be of service in the contemporary world, in which abstraction continues to triumph.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the next chapter, Jean-Paul Sartre—along with other phenomenologists—takes up where Heidegger left off, trying to reground the human in this fact called Being. Sartre’s special relationship with the tree as a real thing and as an idea informs his treatment of the root as a revolting and insistent reminder of existence, which stuns the protagonist at the foot of a chestnut tree in his novel <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i>. The root as the site of Roquentin’s existential crisis was not an arbitrary choice; Sartre had in mind Descartes’s Tree of Philosophy, whose roots are metaphysics. The upheaval of Western metaphysics is, for Sartre, the clear objective of his ontologically radical project. His philosophical investments were not in the land, in culturally or genetically transmitted heritage, or in the problem of primordial origin; while Weil and Heidegger could be described as retrophilic thinkers, with their admiring eyes fixed on the past, Sartre preferred the immediate. His rootedness, similar to the Buddhist’s, was in the here and now, in the fact of Being.</p>
