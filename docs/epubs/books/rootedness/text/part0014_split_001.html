<h2 id="ah0701" class="ah">The Cryptic Rhizome of Deleuze and Guattari</h2>
      <p class="pf">After reading <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> several times and ruminating long and hard, I am still not certain I know what a rhizome is. If poetry and philosophy are the same thing, I can accept this; the rhizome certainly adds a dose of poetic appeal for some theory seekers. But if they aren’t the same thing, I have to wonder why the botanical metaphor that I’ve followed throughout the book with assurance has dissolved in the hands of Deleuze and Guattari. I also must wonder why recent books that argue in favor of vegetal democracy or plant-human empathy, books directly influenced by poststructuralism and rhizome-centered thinking, are as problematic as the nationalist claims of Barrès and the mystically infused autochthony of Heidegger. The botanical thought that connects all of these disparate texts and theories always brings strangeness with it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There were moments when I believed I understood the rhizome. I thought it might be a metaphor for describing those phenomena that refuse hierarchy, linearity, and institutionality. I imagined it as an improvisational form that communicates the idealized unmanageability of transmitted culture. It seemed to be a living alternative, something that shared certain features with roots or rootlets, such as the fact that these are all botanical forms that grow underground and are alive and mutable. The rhizome concept seemed to want to provide a language for talking about those forms of thinking and living that do not fit into clear categories or that have not been sanctioned by the state or other centers of power. But as I did more research on how the rhizome has been used by others, especially social scientists, I realized that the concept can be made to mean almost whatever one wants it to mean.<a id="fn479r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn479">2</a> There is certainly <a id="p219" class="page1"></a>something appealing about the alternativeness and malleability of this concept and Deleuze and Guattari’s other nearly synonymous concepts expressed alternately in their corpus through the language of ethnography/anthropology (the nomad), biology (the organless body), and martial mechanics (the war machine), to name just a few. I am certainly sympathetic to a project that would multiply concepts through which the world may be thought, especially when the ultimate objective is to move toward a less West-centric, white-centric, male-centric consideration of this world. However, one must wonder whether the rhizome is so radically different from the root in the end. Ultimately, its application to various discourses does not differ greatly from the application of the root metaphor to these same discourses.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Among recent attempts to turn Europe’s roots into rhizomes, or at least to locate them in unexpected places, is the recent push to locate the roots of poststructuralism in North Africa.<a id="fn480r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn480">3</a> Given that many of the key players responsible for the development of poststructuralist thought were either from Africa (Althusser, Derrida, Cixous) or had been impacted heavily by their time in Africa (Leiris, Foucault, Bourdieu, Lyotard), the notion of “French theory” is destabilized and transformed into “African Theory” or even “Algerian Theory,” “Maghrebine Theory,” “French-African Theory,” “Jewish-African Theory,” <a id="p220" class="page1"></a>and so forth, depending on which theorists are invoked as founders of poststructuralism. What happens to the notion of late Continental philosophy if the origin of ostensibly Continental European ideas in the twentieth century is located not on the European continent but on the African one? This attempt to locate the origin of supposedly European ideas outside Europe is another method for undermining narratives of origin. There seems to be a collective hope that by relocating origin, self-perpetuating Eurocentrism can be—at least provisionally—disrupted. By showing that ideas are never roots but always rhizomes, or that they have no localizable beginning, or that their beginnings are never neatly national, the European is forced to concede a loss of intellectual territory. However, even if the root of contemporary Western thinking is not Western, this does not change the fact of the compulsive search for roots. The attempt to Africanize and nomadize European thought ultimately does not undo its arborescent nature; if anything, it reinforces it. Roots are a given.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">While Derrida tried to set up the conditions for Western thought to uproot itself, Deleuze and Guattari provided alternative metaphors through which all <i class="calibre1">idées reçues</i> could be reworked. This move is similar in structure to one made by the Oulipo when they asked why we should be satisfied with the old literary constraints—like the strictures of the sonnet form, for example—and why we haven’t made more efforts to add new ones rather than repeat the somewhat arbitrary constraints drafted by our forebears. Similarly, Deleuze and Guattari wonder in their pages why we have taken up the old arborescent models with zero reluctance. Why this obsequious indebtedness to the past? Why this indolent compliance with forms that may have expired? The world has the potential to be thought through a different set of images, they posit. Despite their claims that the concepts they propose (rhizome, war machine, nomad, organless body, etc.) are not metaphors, readers cannot but take them as such. The attempt to accept the authors’ claim and read these figures literally unsettles the mind with “great doubt,” much like the exercise of Zen k<span>ō</span>an contemplation. The figures somehow undo themselves when imagined through the lens of the literal. Assuming that they actually are metaphors, what is most captivating about them is their imagistic quality. Deleuze and Guattari attempt, through their literary essayism, to rethink the world using a new set of written pictures. Their grievances against Western arborescence are addressed imagistically rather than textually, despite the written format of their books. In a manner compatible with Derrida’s frustration over the autocracy of writing, Deleuze and Guattari use text only as a means to build up a cache of self-multiplying images.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><a id="p221" class="page1"></a>At times, their metaphors seem to be a mere multiplication of synonymous images and a series of non sequiturs. To get out of this closed circle of interpretation, I try to look more panoramically at how they use metaphors to make their arguments. Deleuze and Guattari’s work offers an excellent occasion for an analysis of philosophers’ appropriations of metaphors. Throughout this book, I have shown how the malleability of the root metaphor allows it to mean one thing, its opposite, and much in between. For some, it is a figure of restrictive immobility, for others a figure of necessary stability. It may represent continuity between past, present, and future, or a stubborn attachment to the past and a refusal of all that comes after. If a metaphor can be massaged into meaning almost anything, what use is it to anyone? What use is a metaphor to a philosopher?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Stephen C. Pepper has suggested, “Every philosophical theory is a far-flung metaphor.”<a id="fn481r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn481">4</a> At times, the rubbery nature of metaphorical language can be philosophy’s strength, particularly since the field focuses so frequently on abstractions. In large part, metaphor allows for an escape from the kind of responsibility that apodictic, metaphor-free language seems to require. When one expresses an idea with an apodictic sentence, void of metaphor—which is the ideal of many philosophers, albeit nearly impossible to achieve—readers are left with little interpretive opportunity. This form of philosophical expression seeks to reduce occasions for misunderstanding and to relieve the philosopher in advance from needing to reiterate, justify, or expound. Perhaps there is readerly philosophy and there is writerly philosophy, to use Barthes’s distinction. The books of Deleuze and Guattari are clearly writerly texts. Their reliance on metaphor seems to be an open invitation to improvisation of meaning on the part of the reader.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">For this reason, I claim that the greatest contribution of their collaborative work belongs to the field of poetics. Read through the lens of literature, <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i>, <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>, and <i class="calibre1">What Is Philosophy?</i> are image-inflected prose improvisations. These books are imagery generators with a goal of self-proliferation. They illustrate the possibilities of an aesthetically conscious kind of writing that is also philosophically, politically, and historically informed, clustering bits of knowledge drawn from these fields around imagistic figures. They do not proceed by argumentation; they proceed by image generation, which continues to operate in the reader even when the pages have all been read. I believe it was a conscious choice on the part of Deleuze and Guattari <a id="p222" class="page1"></a>to make a book that sidesteps the strictures of theory or philosophy, relying instead on the literary and visual imagination of readers to do most of the books’ work. Like Robert Musil and Hermann Broch’s “novels that think,”<a id="fn482r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn482">5</a> which kept expanding various lines of thought, all within the frame of fiction, the collaborative books of Deleuze and Guattari keep going, fueled by an ever-growing stock of “images that think.” A reliance on images was obviously not new to philosophy or theory, but the method of their unfurling in these books, imitative in many respects of Derrida’s image work, tries to mimic the same style of movement as the figures they describe in words (the rhizome and the nomad, for example). These image-centric books are nonetheless thinking texts, literary essays that abound with images that generate other images outside the pages, for example in Edouard Glissant’s appropriation of the rhizome figure and his transformation of it into an archipelagic, relational figure. The collaborative books of Deleuze and Guattari are image factories, or, perhaps a better term, image plants. By spinning out and echoing an endless series of synonymous images that “mean” in the same way, they write a kind of image-reliant thesaurus or picture book of synonyms. In this sense, Deleuze and Guattari engage in a practice similar to that of Paul Claudel, who, as I showed in <a class="page1" href="part0010_split_000.html#ch03">chapter 3</a>, delivers his proselytizing message by inundating his reader with image after image of the symbols of Christian love, combined in every possible configuration. As I will show, they also share a penchant for mysticism. The surrogate universe these three writers create thinks our own world through a different optical apparatus. By replacing argument with a flurry of pictures, they imagine they’ll change minds, since the human is such a visual creature. We no longer choose and commit to one picture; we accumulate and shuffle many.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The appeal of the rhizome concept has continued in many disciplines because, in its preference for imagistic poetics over rhetorical argument, it has the feel of a true expressive alternative. However, replacing the old botanical metaphor with a new one does not radicalize thought in the way Deleuze and Guattari imagined. In their theorization of the rhizome, they sought to unsettle philosophy from its ground, using gestures similar to those of Derrida.<a id="fn483r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn483">6</a> But <a id="p223" class="page1"></a>the root-to-rhizome shift is overly touted as a salvific move toward freedom from the past. In the end, the rhizome is not radically different from the root. It is still an embedded form, its pace of growth is the same, and it represents yet another instance of thinking botanically about thought. Their plant-picture puts them in a long genealogy of Western thinkers who conceive of thought in botanical terms.<a id="fn484r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn484">7</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The rhizome thrives in unpredictable fits and starts below the earth’s surface. The nomad skims smoothly if unforeseeably across the earth’s surface. In both cases, the earth itself is the necessary precondition for their survival. Everything in our world grows from the ground up. Deleuze and Guattari’s coauthored texts are profoundly earthen; that is, they rely constantly on metaphors of ground, earth, geography, geology, and terrestrial unity. For example, from their geocentric preoccupations in <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i> and <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> to their engagements with Nietzschean geophilosophy in their book <i class="calibre1">What Is Philosophy?</i> (1991), they are no less ground-focused than the phenomenologists. In an attempt at an antichronology, each “plateau” of <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> is marked with a year and a title, shuffled out of order. The earliest date they choose, 10,000 BC, is entitled “The Geology of Morals.” By replacing Nietzsche’s “genealogy” with “geology,” Deleuze and Guattari substitute for a vocabulary of human genetic transmission a vocabulary of the terrestrial, perhaps intentionally recalling—through the association of the earlier human and earthly clay—early Greek accounts of the origins of humanity or the Adamic beginning and the subsequent and quick moral fall. Origins are the centerpiece here. In their claim that “Thinking takes place in the relationship of territory and the earth,”<a id="fn485r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn485">8</a> they underscore the fact that our ground, the necessary precondition for all terrestrial life and thought, is never out of mind. Their rhizome is textually embedded in the ground, regardless of their attempts to render this ground seismically unstable. And, while the nomad is not fixed in the dirt, he requires its surface as his platform of potential destinations.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The rhizome has proved to be their most lasting contribution inside and outside philosophy. First in 1976 and then again in 1980, Deleuze and Guattari proposed the rhizome as an alternate metaphor to the root for a nonbinary, nonhierarchical epistemology, and since the publication of their pivotal <a id="p224" class="page1"></a>text, this metaphor has been appropriated by theorists to describe the shift from modernism to postmodernism.<a id="fn486r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn486">9</a> Throughout <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> and their other coauthored works, whose method is described by Alexandra Kogl as “psychedelic,”<a id="fn487r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn487">10</a> Deleuze and Guattari sought to fractalize the ostensibly cohesive and arborescent form of Western thought. Because fractals are by nature centrifugal, their particular method of image-making quickly spread across disciplines and national borders. The rhizome concept, for example, has greatly influenced writers across the globe, such as Edouard Glissant and Antonio Benítez Rojo in the Caribbean, who took up the call in their own writing for a celebration of multiplicity, of dissolved categories, and of the horizontalization of all aspects of life. Deleuze and Guattari’s metaphor has influenced urban planning and architecture, film studies and filmmaking, music, design, literary studies, philosophy, history, political science, gender studies, and most branches of the social sciences. It is difficult to name a single concept that has had more influence on recent research in all of these fields.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">With its emphasis on authorial faltering, limitations, and deficiencies, <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> is a performance of self-doubt.<a id="fn488r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn488">11</a> It is also an evasive text, <i class="calibre1">un texte qui s’esquive</i>; as Christopher Miller has noted, “Catch the authors in a contradiction, and they will merely dissolve the terms that created it, then take off on another ‘line of flight.’”<a id="fn489r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn489">12</a> At times, the book’s introduction reads like a manifesto to the self, a posted reminder of the self-constraints to be respected.<a id="fn490r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn490">13</a> Tipping over into full manifesto mode in the end of the introduction, Deleuze and Guattari write: “Make rhizomes, not roots, never plant! Don’t sow, grow offshoots! Don’t be one or multiple, be multiplicities! Run lines, never plot a point!” (24). The directives continue. Alternately a manifesto, a diary of doubt, a theory-laden academic document, a fiction, a history book, an essay, and many other genres, the text ultimately refuses to decide what it wants to be, <a id="p225" class="page1"></a>which is in itself one of the central motives of the project: to refuse the cleanliness of categories. This poetics of accumulation necessarily results in an unwieldy book, a sedimentary bed where concepts and their opposites amass. This rhetorical rockiness comes through in each and every plateau of the book, leaving many readers at a loss when faced with its lithic opacity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Probably because the introductory chapter is entitled “Introduction: Rhizome,” readers of <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> often walk away from this book taking only the handsomely packageable concept of the rhizome, which can be applied to a variety of fields. If we look closely at this chapter and at the text as a whole, we find countless other metaphors for books of various types.<a id="fn491r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn491">14</a> The rhizomatic book is just one among them. Ultimately, <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> relies much less on botanical metaphors than on geological, geographic, and topological ones. This fact is announced already in the titular “plateaus”—a term they acknowledge was borrowed from Gregory Bateson, cyberneticist <i class="calibre1">extraordinaire</i>—as well as the constant references to stratification, sedimentation, territory, landscape, cartography, the subterranean, and the earth.<a id="fn492r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn492">15</a> They write in the treatise on Nomadology segment that “the earth is before all else the matter upon which the dynamic of lineages is inscribed, and the number and the means of inscription: the lineages write upon the earth and with the number, constituting a kind of ‘geodesy’” (388), that is, the mathematical measurement of vast spaces and the numerical taking into account of their shapes. As I have shown in <a class="page1" href="part0010_split_000.html#ch03">chapter 3</a>, transcendence relies on an immanent ground that must be overcome. In <i class="calibre1">What Is Philosophy?</i>, published more than ten years after <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>, Deleuze and Guattari dedicated an entire chapter to the topic of geophilosophy, claiming that “thinking takes place in the relationship of territory and the earth.”<a id="fn493r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn493">16</a> Following Nietzsche, who <a id="p226" class="page1"></a>tried to locate the philosophical specificity of French, German, and English thought in <i class="calibre1">On the Genealogy of Morals</i>, they puzzle through the role of autochthony in determining the orientation of philosophy. Regarding the Greeks, the distant philosophical forebears who still control European thought even posthumously, they come to the conclusion that “philosophy appears in Greece as a result of contingency rather than necessity, as a result of an ambiance or milieu rather than an origin, of a becoming rather than a history, of a geography rather than a historiography, of a grace rather than a nature.”<a id="fn494r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn494">17</a> Their sustained interest in “becoming” leads them to a conclusion, drawn from Schelling’s and Hölderlin’s depiction of the Greeks, that, invariably, “what was Autochthonous becomes strange; what was strange becomes Autochthonous” (102). These categories barely hold up under this constant sway. In contrast to Weil and Heidegger, with their Graecophilia, Deleuze and Guattari do not exceptionalize the emergence of Greek thought and do not tout it as the origin of all origins. They attempt to undermine the temporal aspects of a philosophical filiation by transforming them into spatial aspects. The ground they had surveyed already in <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i> and <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> loses much of its already precarious solidity in <i class="calibre1">What Is Philosophy?</i> Deleuze and Guattari are by no means the only ones to think the world through a geological frame. The human/<i class="calibre1">humus</i> nexus plays out in the same period in other venues, such as in Kenneth White’s 1989 founding in France of the International Institute of Geopoetics (<i class="calibre1">Institut international de géopoétique</i>) and with Jed Rasula’s elaboration in 2002 of a necropoetics based on the metaphor of compost, as the processing of dead material (and thought) into new material (and thought).<a id="fn495r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn495">18</a> <a id="p227" class="page1"></a>All of these initiatives take the human as necessarily lodged in the earthen loam of this domicile called Planet Earth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The rhizome, itself an unstable form, thrives best underground. In contrast to the earth’s stony surface, on which histories can be carved and measured, the rhizome’s vegetal matter does not last long enough tell a tale and its surface is not dense enough to be inscribed with any lasting message. Any inscription on the rhizome would decompose along with it; it cannot tell History, only Nomadology. Published between the first of Derrida’s <i class="calibre1">trace</i>-concerned texts and Gérard Genette’s 1982 <i class="calibre1">Palimpsestes: La littérature au second degré</i> (<i class="calibre1">Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree</i>), <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> is in sync with the intuitions of Deleuze and Guattari’s intellectual cohort. In unison, they wonder how generations preemptively mark those generations to come and note the pivotal role of stone in this process. Vegetal material becomes a surface for inscription only once it has been processed by the human into paper; even then, its durability is inferior to that of stone. The scroll rolls itself up, its message inside, with the same elastic, inward folding of a living plant. In their <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i>, a book that includes what Emily Apter calls the “presciently postnational vision of deterritorialized subjects,”<a id="fn496r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn496">19</a> this terrestrial emphasis was prefigured in the many passages that underscore the role of Earth as the ground from which everything else originates.<a id="fn497r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn497">20</a> The rhizome metaphor has been singled out and plucked from the soil of the edaphic text in which it was embedded. But this is to be expected: the authors invited such a singling-out by refusing the totalizing format of a book that presents and sustains itself procedurally. Concepts cannot but be extracted casually and in discrete units from their book, like many a Nietzschean aphorism.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Despite their claims that the rhizome is radically different from the root, the similarities between the two botanical forms far outweigh their dissimilarities. Put in another way, the rhizome allows one to dispose of the root without disposing of rootedness. The rhizome had just as much of an underground <a id="p228" class="page1"></a>beginning as the root; the root is as much “in process” as the rhizome.<a id="fn498r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn498">21</a> In fact, in comparing a real root and a real rhizome, the characteristics assigned to them by Deleuze and Guattari seem rather reversed. The root does not respect the neat one-becomes-two bifurcating order they describe, nor do many trees; often, the root is instead a tangled and uneven chaos of fibrils, hairs, and wormlike articulations. Even with its curious contours, the rhizome—in the form of ginger, for example—can be still relatively smooth with a clear-cut shape and a solid consistency in contrast to the enmeshed muddle of the root. Perhaps they would argue that I am taking these forms too literally, but if they really are not metaphors, how else is one to take them? This is not the only contradiction in the book. Despite their attempts to challenge the conventions of bookmaking by suggesting that the various plateaus are readable in any order, they are still explicit that the introduction must be read first and the conclusion last.<a id="fn499r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn499">22</a> We could perhaps say that <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> resembles the <i class="calibre1">livre-radicelle</i> even more than the <i class="calibre1">livre-rhizome</i>, putting them alongside modernists like James Joyce and Nietzsche who, they claim, wrote rootlet-books rather than rhizome-books. In their depiction, rootlet-books function on the principle of cyclical chaos; this applies as well to Deleuze and Guattari’s collaborative work, in which the same motifs recur in sporadic fashion.<a id="fn500r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn500">23</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The subterranean aspects of <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> certainly include the many geological metaphors listed above, but the underground is also exploited in its figurative sense as that which is hidden and enigmatic.<a id="fn501r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn501">24</a> Mark Bonta argues that Deleuze “was closely attuned to the subterranean mystical currents <a id="p229" class="page1"></a>that pervade Western religiosity.”<a id="fn502r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn502">25</a> Putting him in a genealogy with “a long line of Western intellectuals who have engaged Western esotericism and ‘secret knowledge’” (62–63), Bonta approximates Deleuze with Jakob Boehme (1575–1624), the German theologian and Christian mystic who published texts such as <i class="calibre1">Mysterium pansophicum</i> (1620) and <i class="calibre1">Mysterium magnum</i> (1623), focusing on the origins of the earth and other terrestrial and celestial mysteries.<a id="fn503r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn503">26</a> Derrida, too, has been accused, by many of his own brand, of mystification and obscurantism, each of his texts being the unfulfilled promise of a recovery of buried meaning.<a id="fn504r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn504">27</a> When Derrida writes, “There has been and always will be philosophical mystification, speculation on the end and the ends of philosophy,”<a id="fn505r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn505">28</a> he thinks from the end backward, implying that mystification occurs at both the beginning and the end of thought. As a philosopher, he belongs to the paradoxical discipline that seems to seek truth but unwittingly obfuscates it through an endless series of speculative gestures groping for unknowable beginnings and endings. As I have shown in <a class="page1" href="part0008_split_000.html#ch01">chapter 1</a>, the subterranean aspect of the root invites a mystical metaphorization. In the debates about the vegetative soul and the inscrutable connection between the human and the plant, poststructuralism and then postmetaphysical philosophy have taken up where mysticism left off. In terms of its botanical content, Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome image provides an important link between the mystical preoccupations about the uprooted human—as found in Claudel’s, Heidegger’s, and Weil’s thought—and the posthuman ontologies that proliferate in philosophy today. Claudel and Weil privilege Christian mysticism, while Heidegger privileges a more paganistic mysticism, although it is easy to make the claim that <a id="p230" class="page1"></a>Christianity never managed to rid itself of the residue of paganism. One can readily identify the paganistic elements that Christianity absorbed into its own metaphysics. The mystery among the trees cannot be uprooted, even in late-twentieth-century philosophy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Regarding the arguments presented in <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>, many critics have transformed Deleuze and Guattari’s trichotomy <i class="calibre1">livre-racine–livre-radicelle–livre-rhizome</i> into a dichotomy, focusing primarily on the first and third terms but disregarding the second. This tendency to disregard a Third Term—as a general category, as a symbol for that which throws dualistic thinking off-kilter—illustrates the perennial disdain toward a “complicating element,” even in this text that operates according to the principle of proliferation beyond binaries. When Deleuze and Guattari published this antibinary text in 1980, our digital lives were just beginning to get under way. This was the year, for example, when IBM hired Bill Gates and when Apple made its Initial Public Offering in the stock market. Digital life and digital death go hand in hand: already in 1981, the first alleged death-by-computer-game occurred.<a id="fn506r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn506">29</a> The misgivings toward binary thinking expressed earlier by Derrida and then by Deleuze and Guattari at the dawn of the 1980s may strike us as prescient, now that so many of the public debates in our moment center around the beneficial and harmful aspects of life governed by ones and zeros.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Binarization is not the only dangerous aspect of root- or rootlet-centered thinking, in their view. They qualify rootedness as hazardous, a direct rebuttal of the position of Weil and Heidegger, who viewed rootedness as a necessity for human well-being. For Deleuze and Guattari, the root and the rootlet are enemies of desire, of spontaneity, and of multiplicity. Root thinking follows the closed narrative of beginning, middle, and end; rootlet-thinking works in seemingly chaotic but repetitive circles. Both kinds of thought originate in a center. Deleuze and Guattari summarize the characteristics of the rhizome, which embodies for them an alternative to the exhausted and exhausting root and rootlet systems. The rhizome “connects any point to any other point,” has no clear beginning nor end, and represents an “anti-genealogy.”<a id="fn507r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn507">30</a> Deleuze and Guattari want to move away from the classical two-dimensional format of the traced root on paper and expand it into a four-dimensional phenomenon, plastic and dynamic in time and space. Following a logic of accumulation (“and . . . and . . . and . . .”) rather than selection (“either/or”), the rhizome <a id="p231" class="page1"></a>accepts anything and everything as a potential line of continuance. Our authors advocate an expansion of the field of possibilities, wondering why must we be limited by cultural impulse or habit. They imply that culture suffers from something akin to repetitive motion disorder; in copying by reflex the same compartmentalizations and hierarchies, we ultimately do harm to culture, causing it to break down. In the more epistemologically oriented portions of the book, they reject an arborescent depiction of the brain and its processes.<a id="fn508r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn508">31</a> Instead, they propose a more complex and less hierarchical model composed of “acentered systems.”<a id="fn509r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn509">32</a> Decentralization is one of the primary characteristics of a rhizomatic epistemology. As Emily Apter writes, “The rhizome functions as a social pathogen, an antistatist virus or Agent Orange of nonassimilation,”<a id="fn510r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn510">33</a> an image that conveys the invasive nature of the rhizome in the centered social sphere. It is not that the rhizomatic form does not have what might be called “points of interest,” with lines intersecting to form meaningful junctions. The nodal integrity of the botanical form is maintained, but these convergences are multiple and nonhierarchical. Rather than a central taproot through which all energies are dispensed and received, thought is conceived as an erratic pattern sustained in its spontaneous dynamism by acentric stores of energy. Privileging short-term over long-term memory—and it seems that they mean “memory” in both an individual and a collective sense<a id="fn511r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn511">34</a>—they argue that the rhizomatic instantaneity of the former operates under the conditions of “discontinuity, rupture, and multiplicity” (16).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The building blocks of the rhizome are described alternately as molecules, atoms, particles, genes, and other microscopic units, but the most interesting of these components are fibrous forms like the strand, the string, and the filament, which Deleuze and Guattari use to create an antigenealogical string theory. They find in the string a more or less elementary form with a tensile nature; it can be elongated, and it may function as a line of connection between two points. In its abstract and geometrical form, they write merely of the line. <a id="p232" class="page1"></a>They argue that writing, life, and destiny are all made of lines.<a id="fn512r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn512">35</a> One of their favored expressions, <i class="calibre1">lignes de fuite</i>, or lines of flight, describes the volatile vectors of the rhizome, the wild cards of the form. These lines share with essayistic digression the will to abandon discursive and formal predictability, and they avert the possibility of stable dualisms. The authors introduce the fiber, a small organic unit transferable between humans and animals (and implicitly plants as well), into the rhizomatic vocabulary to illustrate the hyphenated concept of “becoming-(animal, human, etc.).” Because these fibrillary units change place, “dis-integrating” themselves from one body only to join another, they essentially dissolve the secure and insular identity of the individual. As turbulent protuberances, they break away and tack themselves at will to other forms. Like a shag carpet whose fibrils detach and reattach themselves to other things (skin, clothing, pets, furniture), the borders of the body are more fuzzy than that of a block-solid. In Deleuze and Guattari’s vision, bodies are filamentary accretions. They also give a strandular form to the elements that make up the rhizomatic structure, using a metaphor borrowed from Ernst Jünger: that of marionette strings. They write, “Puppet strings, as a rhizome or multiplicity, are tied not to the supposed will of an artist or puppeteer but to a multiplicity of nerve fibers, which form another puppet in other dimensions connected to the first” (8). The marionette strings are not pulled by a performer but by the neural dendrites, the live wires of the nervous system that set his body in motion. These are strings that pull strings. The fatherly manager has been ousted and replaced by the billions of strands responsible for all of his agency. This new shift in responsibility actively decenters central power.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And if the father is decentered, the family tree is thrown off-kilter. In their antigenealogical string theory, Deleuze and Guattari replace <i class="calibre1">filius</i> (<i class="calibre1">le fils</i>, “the son”) with (<i class="calibre1">les fils</i>, “strings”).<a id="fn513r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn513">36</a> They accept the fact of influence, but genealogical transmission of influence is where they draw the line. Their new strandular logic does away with the straightness of bloodlines and the neatness of hereditary transmission through filiation. This was already a major theme in <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i>, which juxtaposed filiation and alliance as social, not biologic, <a id="p233" class="page1"></a>realities.<a id="fn514r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn514">37</a> Favoring production over reproduction, they explain in <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i> that “a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model” (12). Disregarding the distantly rooted forebears, Deleuze and Guattari invest their energies in the figure of the child, the highest-reaching branch of the family tree, for a way out of rooted thinking. For them, the child manages to break loose from the system of reproduction.<a id="fn515r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn515">38</a> In a move contrary to that of thinkers who look toward the ancestors for wisdom, they look to the child as a salvational model. History and heredity are shakable habits; they can be replaced by the improvisational and uninhibited spontaneity of the child. Deleuze and Guattari are tired of the tree, in its genealogical form and in its role as epistemological figure; a way out of arborescent logic is the recognition of the multiple elementary forms that make it, those young and capricious strands that undo the integrity of the tree as a cohesive unit. The intellectual self-orphaning of Deleuze and Guattari is somehow worked through in the nurturing of this metaphorical child, wrested from the oppressive family line but in need of guardianship.<a id="fn516r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn516">39</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The “becoming-elementary” entailed in this particularization of matter and thought is not far removed from other forms of elementarity we have encountered throughout this study. The various iterations of “becoming-elementary,” what could equally be called “becoming-original,” “becoming-primeval,” “becoming-autochthonous,” “becoming-foundational,” “becoming-fundamental,” and other improvised compounds, entail a scrutiny of the building blocks of existence and of civilization. Deleuze and Guattari have replaced the phenomenologists’ emphasis on Being with a new emphasis on Becoming. <a id="p234" class="page1"></a>Rather than an appeal for a return to the foundations, they favor probing the composition of these forms in order to show that they are much less solid than imagined. David Macauley, in his book <i class="calibre1">Elemental Philosophy</i>, traces a genealogy from Empedocles’s ideas on elemental roots to Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatic thinking. He writes that “Empedocles’ ideas may be reasonably interpreted so as to show an anticipation or foreshadowing of the theory of evolution, an attentiveness to and deep sympathy with sentient organisms and nonhuman entities, and a discourse germane to comprehending environmental contamination.”<a id="fn517r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn517">40</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">A primary reason for the establishment of this genealogy is Empedocles’s use of the term <i class="calibre1">rhizomata</i>, which means the roots or elements of earth, water, air, and fire.<a id="fn518r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn518">41</a> Empedocles’s fifth-century elemental iteration of rootedness is an early instance of the connection between what is <i class="calibre1">basic</i> to our cosmos, in terms of both cause and composition, and what burgeons distantly from an original event. When Deleuze and Guattari take up the elemental becoming, they do their best to remain antifoundational, but in a way that differs from Derrida. Derrida points to the quiet chokehold of the ground on all Western thought and seeks to make this thought uproot itself by showing the contradictions, the lacunae, and the violences inherent to it, whereas Deleuze and Guattari pulverize this ground, breaking it into its smallest parts, thus undoing the solidity of what was thought to be <i class="calibre1">terra firma</i>. They point to the spaces in between the constitutive units of the foundation, suddenly revealing the looseness of the terrain on which Western thought is positioned.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">To bind their compositional metaphors (the layer, the particle, the gene, the assemblage, the string, the element, etc.), Deleuze and Guattari devote a significant amount of attention to the relationships between these composite parts. Their thought is optimized in a four-dimensional framework (three spatial dimensions in time), allowing them to incorporate time and space into their discussions of various relationships between the discrete units mentioned above (superimposition, chronology, simultaneity, analogy, yoking, adjacency). The rhizome, with a firm shape in its nonmetaphorical form, is rendered in their writing as a hazier figure, similar to fog, blur, and other forms <a id="p235" class="page1"></a>of in-between-ness, what they refer to as haecceity.<a id="fn519r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn519">42</a> They emphasize the indefiniteness of form and its ability to fool the one who perceives it as uncompromisingly solid. What is refreshing in Deleuze and Guattari’s thought, and what accounts for its loud and long resonance, is its permission to take seriously the foggy, wordless, in-between notches in culture.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In their aim to convince, they desperately seek a noninstitutionalized method to reorient the institution, for any method sanctioned by “the system” would be inherently flawed. Philosophy is a discipline composed, in large part, of countless networks of debates, mostly between men, about things of which no one can ever be certain but which must be portrayed as knowable in order for the discipline to continue. Theory, as I understand it, is a synonym for philosophy minus the reputation of being governed by <i class="calibre1">les éminences grises</i>, as it publicizes itself as more accommodating to a broader demographic. While we may attribute to philosophy a more arborescent logic and to theory a more rhizomatic one, the “treeness” (<i class="calibre1">Baumheit</i>) is no less present in the rhizomatic form. Cutting down the tree of philosophy, pruning it, uprooting it, decorating it, tapping it, climbing it, contemplating it, building a house in it or out of it, or giving it another name: it seems that thought cannot escape arborealization in the Western imagination. A tree is inseverably a tree.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">On the other hand, if we approach the coauthored texts of Deleuze and Guattari as literature—given that they call attention repeatedly to their own aesthetic making, they rely on metaphors and vivid imagery, and their experimental character has clear antecedents in literary prose and poetry—there is less pressure to sacralize their thought. Because they are both philosophers, one is tempted to read everything they write as philosophy, but I believe the rhizomatic and nomadic ruminations of Deleuze and Guattari have had their most significant impact not in philosophy, not in politics, not in history, but in poetics. In consonance with Elizabeth Bruss, who analyzed the aesthetic aspects of theory in her book <i class="calibre1">Beautiful Theories: The Spectacle of Discourse in Contemporary Criticism</i> (1982), I read Deleuze and Guattari’s coauthored books as rich literary texts that unfix the categories of essay, history, and theory. Compounded by the fact that theory, like fiction, does most of its work in the virtual mode, the imaginative component of Deleuze and Guattari’s collaborations could qualify them all the more as literary texts. In his <i class="calibre1">A Nomad Poetics: Essays</i> (2003), the Luxembourger-American writer Pierre Joris writes, “What <a id="p236" class="page1"></a>is needed now is a nomadic poetics. Its method will be <i class="calibre1">rhizomatic</i>. . . . A nomadic poetics will cross languages, not just translate, but write in all or any of them.”<a id="fn520r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn520">43</a> He continues, explaining that a nomadic poetics will take “into account not only the manifold of languages &amp; locations but also of selves each one of us is constantly becoming” (44).<a id="fn521r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn521">44</a> An outstanding contemporary example of a nomad or rhizome poetics in France can be found in the work of Antoine Volodine, whose transnational panoply of narrative voices emits from the living and the dead through time and space, each of his texts energized by what he calls revolutionary shamanism. Patrick Chamoiseau’s <i class="calibre1">Biblique des derniers gestes</i> (2002) and Claudio Magris’s <i class="calibre1">Alla cieca</i> (2005) also display many of the characteristics of nomadic, rhizomatic writing. A poetics of the rhizome will undoubtedly be pursued by many writers, consciously or unconsciously, in this first half of the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Proponents of Deleuze and Guattari should not be disappointed if their texts are taken for “merely” literary ones; the most staggering cultural changes often must happen first in literature, music, and art, which provide the space where new ideas may be tried out without the requirement of apodictic certainty. Throughout this book, I’ve made the case that human rootedness is the dangerous literalization of a metaphor. If literature welcomes metaphor and, better yet, invites the abandoning or refashioning of old ones and the creation of new ones, then it is possible to imagine literature as a potential site of the deliteralization or weakening of certain metaphors. An infiltration through images, an aesthetic crafting of a better metaphor than the root, may be the most effective way to convince people that they are almost never truly bound to the land where they dwell.</p>
