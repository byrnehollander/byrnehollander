      <p class="pf">The inversion of plants has a long history in the natural sciences, literature, and philosophy of the West. In the natural sciences, this inversion unfolds in the experimental mode as a trial meant to discover the adaptability of plants to new positions other than those in which they naturally orient themselves. Through such an experiment, the scientist interrogates the flow of the plant’s sap and the water and minerals it ingests, questions the role of light and darkness and their effects on roots and branches, and asks whether a plant’s orientation is absolute or relative. Must branches always grow away from the earth’s center and the roots toward it, or does the plant have a natural calibration mechanism that helps it recognize up from down? In literature and philosophy, however, this type of inversion generally equates plant with human, necessarily acting as a figurative device to explore human adaptability. Similar experimental objectives still apply, however. Is the human’s existence absolute or relative? Do humans really know up (transcendence) from down (banality at best, failure or damnation at worst), or are they so fixed in their patterns of existence and thought that they persist in one or the other direction out of habit rather than sureness of course? In their figurative iteration, uprooting and replanting mean revealing what was hidden and hiding what was earlier visible; they mean derailing a “natural” process to see how the human responds. There is a double violence in this action: first, a ripping of the roots from the soil, then a subsequent suffocation of the leaves and stems in the cavity that is left. One could imagine claustrophobia and agoraphobia as immediate responses, as the green and breathing top of the plant is buried in the asphyxiating soil, and the roots, <a id="p96" class="page1"></a>so at ease in the dark and quiet, are suddenly exposed and naked to the light and the elements. The reversal is both a physical and a metaphysical upheaval.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In order for plant inversion to be read as a figure for metaphysical conversion, an analogy must be made between plant and human, a <i class="calibre1">topos</i> with a long history in European thought and literature. Rather than provide exhaustive examples of this analogy, I’ll limit myself to a few cases pertinent to the connection I will make between (up-)rootedness and conversion. First, Aristotle argued in his <i class="calibre1">De partibus animalium</i> that the animal and the human are both a sort of inverted plant: “Thus the animal becomes a plant that has its upper parts downwards and its lower parts above. For in plants the roots are the equivalents of mouth and head, while the seed has an opposite significance, for it is produced above at the extremities of the twigs.”<a id="fn180r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn180">35</a> Plants, then, modeled an inverted version of perfection. Animals achieved the switched order of organs but not the verticality. Only humans were able to combine the animal’s inverted bodily functions and the plant’s verticality into the perfect divine being. The noble, vertical bearing of the humans was prefigured in the bearing of the plants.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The philosopher and physician Julien Offray de La Mettrie attempted to create an analogy between the human and the plant in his strange text <i class="calibre1">L’homme-plante</i>, published in 1748. In the preface, he writes, “Here, man is metamorphosed into plant, but don’t assume that this is a fiction suited to Ovid’s taste. The simple analogy of the botanical realm and the animal realm made me discover that the main components of one could be found in the other.”<a id="fn181r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn181">36</a> Both in Aristotle’s depiction and in La Mettrie’s, the human and the plant are considered not in their wholeness but in terms of the individual constituents of their bodily mechanism. For some thinkers and botanists, such as Aristotle and Edouard Grimard, the roots are analogically the head of the human.<a id="fn182r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn182">37</a> For others, such as La Mettrie and the English agriculturalist Jethro Tull, the roots are the stomach or digestive system.<a id="fn183r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn183">38</a> For still others, the roots are compared to stationary feet.<a id="fn184r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn184">39</a> One could make equally compelling arguments <a id="p97" class="page1"></a>for each of these positions, illustrating in the end that the human body is analogically comparable to that of the plant only when considered piecemeal, not as a whole.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the early twentieth century, the American botanist Luther Burbank (1849–1926) attempted to think analogically about the plant and the human, not in terms of their anatomy but in terms of their capacity to crossbreed. In his 1907 text <i class="calibre1">The Training of the Human Plant</i>, Burbank writes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">I have constantly been impressed with the similarity between the organization and development of plant and human life. While I have never lost sight of the principle of the survival of the fittest and all that it implies as an explanation of the development and progress of plant life, I have come to find in the crossing of species and in selection, wisely directed, a great and powerful instrument for the transformation of the vegetable kingdom along the lines that lead constantly upward. The crossing of species is to me paramount. . . . Before passing to the consideration of the adaptation of the principles of plant culture and improvement in a more or less modified form to the human being, let me lay emphasis on the opportunity now presented in the United States for observing and, if we are wise, aiding in what I think it fair to say is the grandest opportunity ever presented of developing the finest race the world has ever known out of the vast mingling of races brought here by immigration.<a id="fn185r" class="fnref1" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn185">40</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">This passage is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it is of interest to us in its depiction of selective breeding as an upwardly progressive phenomenon, a transcendence of a perceived genetic stagnancy in the human species. Burbank is essentially proposing an improvement of the human genetic pool by imitating the crossbreeding experiments he has found to be successful in plants. In other words, it is the botanical world that offers itself as a model to humans for the advancement of the species. His description of the trajectory of a species toward greater fitness as “constantly moving upward” signals his understanding of the evolutionary process as a transcendent one. Second, Burbank argues that the United States, given its “naturally” diverse immigrant population, provides perfect laboratorial conditions for an experiment that could confirm his hypothesis that species improvement is possible through “wisely directed” crossbreeding. Finally, Burbank seems to suggest that humans could be easily persuaded to offer themselves up for experimental breeding, taking on the same passive role as test subjects as the plants had. This would involve <a id="p98" class="page1"></a>a willingness on the part of the subject to breed with whomever the scientist deems most fit as a genetically compatible partner. Following the “voie végétale” or “botanical path” is the way to better humans.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">While Burbank makes it clear that he is consciously applying his discoveries about plants to the human in order to initiate an improvement of the species, other botanists’ experiments were only retroactively seen to have some relevance to the human, often as metaphorical and moralizing applications. In the eighteenth century, the discipline of botany thrived. Thousands of strange experiments on trees, flowers, mosses, grasses, and other forms of botanical life were conducted throughout Europe during the period, but one in particular has held its ground in French cultural memory. The botanist Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau, who eventually conducted hundreds of experiments designed to test the adaptability of plants, had the peculiar idea of uprooting trees and replanting them upside down to see what would happen. The objective of Duhamel’s plant inversion experiment was to confirm the directionality of sap flow and test the role of gravity in this flux. He doubted that the circulation of sap in the botanical bodies was analogous to the circulation of fluids in animal bodies. The centripetal vector of the plant’s fluids in normal conditions made him wonder whether this centeredness was relative or absolute. His own account of these trials adopts the objective voice of the scientist. However, the imaginations of future writers such as Gaston Bachelard, Paul Valéry, Michel Tournier, and others borrowed this intriguing curiosity as a figure for human transformation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Edouard Grimard provides a colorful account of Duhamel’s tree-inversion experiment, in which the botanist tortures the plant by thrusting its breathing head underground but proves the plant’s incredible improvisational power to reverse itself. While the author does wax poetic in his depiction of the experiment, his personification of the willow and his appeal to the reader to sympathize with the tree (what Francis Ponge might call “siding with things”<a id="fn186r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn186">41</a>) provides another example of plant and human viewed as mutual surrogates. The critical responses to Duhamel’s experiment reflected an aversion to the unorthodox: the scientist was reversing the order of things. This experiment in particular was often cited as an example of a scientific quirk. However, the Encyclopédistes praised Duhamel’s experiment as the kind of unconventional trial necessary for the progression of secular humanism. In the tree entry <a id="p99" class="page1"></a>(“<i class="calibre1">Arbre”</i>) of the <i class="calibre1">Dictionnaire raisonné universel d’histoire naturelle</i>, Pierre Daubenton and Denis Diderot chronicle the method of Duhamel’s experiment in an objective tone. However, they close the “Arbre” entry with the following passage:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">It follows that, from all the above examples, the more one studies nature, the more one is astonished to find, in the most seemingly base subjects, phenomena worthy of all of the attention and curiosity of the Philosopher. It is not enough to follow nature in its ordinary, settled course; one must try to throw it off course in order to know all of its fecundity and resources. The people will laugh at the Philosopher when they see him busy in his garden uprooting trees only to put their crowns in the ground and their roots in the air. But these people will be amazed when they see the branches take root and the roots become covered with leaves. Every day, the wise man plays the role of Democritus, and those around him, the role of the Abderites. This adventure dates from the first ages of Philosophy and continues today.<a id="fn187r" class="fnref1" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn187">42</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">This remarkable passage draws an analogy between the task of the philosopher and that of the botanist, or rather, it labels the botanist <i class="calibre1">as</i> a philosopher. Both objects of derision and doubt, these figures who embody the life of the curious mind do not rely indiscriminately on the methods of their forebears, nor are they satisfied to accept prevailing beliefs as indisputable fact. They are not deterred by implausibility and do not allow their neighbors’ skepticism to sway them from their unorthodox projects. Democritus, the laughing philosopher, is cast here as an antecedent of and a model for the eighteenth-century philosopher and the botanist willing to take risks. All three figures—Democritus, philosopher, and naturalist—are sage visionaries capable of seeing already what others cannot yet.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Diderot and Daubenton could have chosen among countless strange experiments to illustrate the tension between the persevering thinker and his sneering observers. Duhamel’s tree inversion, however, was particularly effective because it illustrates an inversion of nature and brings together, in the Platonic tradition, the human, the plant, and that “most authoritative part of our soul . . . living in the summit of the body.”<a id="fn188r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn188">43</a> While for Plato, the head houses the soul, for Daubenton and Diderot, it houses the <i class="calibre1">esprit</i>, the “mind” rather than the “spirit.” Rhetorically, Daubenton and Diderot clearly attempt <a id="p100" class="page1"></a>to persuade the reader to consider a different way of seeing and being in the world and to understand that transformation is possible. Modeling the ideal enlightened mind, the Democritus-Duhamel analogy promotes risk and unorthodoxy. However, given the accusations that the Enlightenment itself is not immune to dogmatic proclamations, the transformation they propose could easily be read as a proselytizing effort, as a coaxing toward conversion. Their appeal, though indirect, urges the metamorphosis of a scoffing populace into a reflective, curious, and bold nation where reason trumps superstition or blind faith. The inverted plant is not only an object of curiosity for the incredulous onlookers; it is, by extension, a figure for how they should change their minds.<a id="fn189r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn189">44</a></p>
