      <p class="pf">The Congolese writer Alain Mabanckou, in his keynote address at the Twentieth- and Twenty-first-century French and Francophone Studies Conference in Long Beach, California, in 2012, told how he had wondered why in Europe and the United States, the umbilical cord is discarded after a baby is born. In the Congo, it is kept and buried in the soil of home, which remains a permanent place of return. With this symbolic attachment of the child to her homeland, a transfer from the mother’s body to the body of Mother Earth, initiation into life begins with a tethering. Africa, the imagined cradle of humanity, is by no means the only place where roots and home are synonymous.<a id="fn15r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn15">12</a> Despite the absence of such a ritual in Europe and the United States, the language of rootedness to one’s home is omnipresent and seems a nearly universal trope across cultures.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">I would like to begin with a very typical illustration of the language used to express one’s rootedness to home, a first example of what I’ll call radical portraiture, a biographical or autobiographical depiction of a person that relies heavily on tropes of rootedness to the land. This excerpt from Guy de Maupassant’s <i class="calibre1">Le horla</i> influenced Maurice Barrès’s <i class="calibre1">roman à thèse Les déracinés</i> (1897), a vindication of regional embeddedness.<a id="fn16r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn16">13</a> The protagonist of Maupassant’s novella declares in the first paragraph: “I love the country here, and I love living here because this is where I have my roots, those profound and delicate roots that attach a man to the land where his ancestors were born and died, and that attach him to what one should think and what one should eat; to customs as well as foods; to local idioms and peasant intonations; to the smells of the earth, of the villages, of the air itself.”<a id="fn17r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn17">14</a> A rich rereading of <i class="calibre1">Le horla</i> is <a id="p22" class="page1"></a>possible through a focus on this rhizocentric <i class="calibre1">incipit</i>, which could occasion an entirely different analysis of the Brazilian demon that arrives on the ship to disturb the protagonist’s rootedness. This passage is a prime example of radical portraiture, whose typical elements—in biographical or autobiographical form, as fiction or nonfiction—include the blurring of the line between country as polity and country as landscape; a lexicon of attachment; an appeal to ancestral heritage; an insistence on specificity; sensorial enumerations; intimations of both the physical and the psychological associations with the homeland; and a hinting at an ineffable something that distinguishes this place from all others, a difference that language cannot accommodate. These characteristics are amplified in narratives in which the home is missing. Homesickness—known in French as <i class="calibre1">le mal du pays</i> and in German as <i class="calibre1">Heimweh</i>—is the greatest occasion for a reverence toward roots. Because the root is a figure of vital will and yearning—as it pushes through the soil, reaching for what it needs—the longing for home makes sense as a root image. Consider this poem by Robert Morgan called “Homesickness,” in which the eyes of potatoes begin to reach, as a form of remembering:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Potatoes left in darkness keep</p>
        <p class="sl">their eyes closed tightly, but</p>
        <p class="sl">potatoes touched by hint of light</p>
        <p class="sl">will sprout translucent shoots from eyes</p>
        <p class="sl">that stretch and feel around and crawl</p>
        <p class="sl">toward the illuminating source,</p>
        <p class="sl">as though remembering a home</p>
        <p class="sl">and luminous spark of vitality</p>
        <p class="sl">in distant world and distant time,</p>
        <p class="sl">across genetic memory</p>
        <p class="sl">and evolution’s tangled tree,</p>
        <p class="sl">to germ of the original bloom</p>
        <p class="sl">across the gulf of history.<a id="fn18r" class="fnref1" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn18">15</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">The separation between home and here, between the ancestors and ourselves, is often an unbridgeable gap, which, however, does not prevent the impulse to recover points of connection with what has become remote; this seems to be an inherently human trait. Regarding the burial of the dead, Robert Harrison argues that “humans bury not simply to achieve closure and effect a separation <a id="p23" class="page1"></a>from the dead but also and above all to humanize the ground on which they build their worlds and found their histories.”<a id="fn19r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn19">16</a> But this separation from the dead at the time of burial is provisional; the rest of our lives are spent trying to recuperate a lost connection with them and with the earth, from which we feel permanently alienated. The “germ of the original bloom” and the “genetic memory” in Morgan’s poem express a longing for existential rootedness and the return home. However, as the narrative of this study unfolds, we’ll see that <i class="calibre1">Heimweh</i>, or homesickness, is always at odds with <i class="calibre1">Fernweh</i>, or wanderlust. The centripetal or centrifugal tendency of individuals and collectives turns sentimentality into a political dilemma.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Home is never neutral. In some cases, it symbolizes the corrupt site of painful memories, bad habits, outdated values, or traumas that were never given language. In Maryse Condé’s polyvocal novel <i class="calibre1">Crossing the Mangrove</i> (<i class="calibre1">Traversée de la mangrove</i>, 1989), one of the characters claims that problems resemble trees because their roots are invisible.<a id="fn20r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn20">17</a> When one character tells another that he wants to write a book entitled <i class="calibre1">Traversée de la mangrove</i> (the same as the title of the book the reader has in his or her hands), she shrugs her shoulders and replies, “You don’t cross a mangrove. You’d spike yourself on the roots of the mangrove trees. You’d be sucked down and suffocated by the brackish mud” (158). The root is that which trips, as the mangrove roots jut from the surface, making it very difficult to cross the swamp. Consciously or unconsciously, Condé was pointing toward the etymology of the word <i class="calibre1">scandal</i>, which can mean a stumbling block or a snare. The entire novel is full of scandal after scandal, collective and individual, each emerging from the past to haunt various central and minor characters. Condé uses the root of the mangrove tree, a species native to Guadeloupe, as a figure for the arch-scandal, that hidden collective or individual history that catches the foot or drags the body of its victim to the underworld, showing that the past has the power to catch up with the present and pull it down and backward. The problems of today are extensions of the scandals of the past, particularly the original colonial scandal. Where can Caribbeans who lived during colonization and after it locate their roots? When home is destroyed, left behind, or conquered, the urgency to feel <a id="p24" class="page1"></a>rooted increases exponentially. A significant pattern: Rootedness matters most when it is threatened.</p>
