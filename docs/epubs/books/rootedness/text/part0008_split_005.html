      <p class="pf">Evil is often imagined as a rooted phenomenon.<a id="fn44r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn44">41</a> Bachelard closes his reflections with a brief mention of the deadly mandrake (man + dragon, etymologically), the homunculus root he takes to represent the phallus.<a id="fn45r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn45">42</a> The plant is <a id="p33" class="page1"></a>known for its potential to increase fertility but also to kill humans and dogs. The long cultural history of the mandrake includes its presence in the Rachel and Leah story in Genesis, its countless mentions in European texts on witchcraft and magic—particularly in the Middle Ages—for its healing and harmful properties, Shakespeare’s repeated use of it, and its brief appearance in Beckett’s <i class="calibre1">Waiting for Godot</i>.<a id="fn46r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn46">43</a> This anthropomorphic root, a small vegetal member, can kill when it is uprooted, but it can also be a source of fertility. In some iterations, wrenching the little man from the earth is akin to castrating him. Albert-Marie Schmidt, in his book <i class="calibre1">La mandragore</i>, notes that humans have a tendency to equate themselves with plants.<a id="fn47r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn47">44</a> This tendency makes the opposite projection—equating a plant with a human—extremely easy, especially in the case of the mandrake, whose form often resembles a small human with arms, legs, and a torso. The mythology of a miniature root person has had a particular hold on the German imagination. Many twentieth-century German-language children’s books feature the Wurzelmännchen (the little root man).<a id="fn48r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn48">45</a> <a id="p34" class="page1"></a>Early European cinema, and German cinema in particular, abounds with mandrake imagery, most prominently as the Germanic legend of Alraune (the feminized version of the noun <i class="calibre1">Alraun</i>, or mandrake), which appeared in at least five different German versions between 1918 and 1952.<a id="fn49r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn49">46</a> We are far from Machiavelli’s comic vision of the mandrake in his play <i class="calibre1">La mandragola</i>, published in 1524.<a id="fn50r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn50">47</a> In the twentieth century, a deep-seated fear of science drives the new mandrake mythology, which illustrates the horrors of experiments that toy with the biologic constitution of the human by melding the DNA of plants and people. The films seem to suggest that when humanity forgets its place in the natural order, it is destined to be eradicated. The renewed interest in the mandrake was spurred by Hanns Heinz Ewers’s 1911 book <i class="calibre1">Alraune</i>, about a scientist who conducts an experiment on a woman, impregnating her by means of a mandrake root, which grew on the ground below the gallows where hanged criminals spilled their sperm. The woman conceives a child named Alraune who grows into a perverse and sexually obsessed woman because of her genetic inheritance from the abject plant. Toward the end of the most famous version, Henrick Galeen’s expressionist film of 1928, the scientist responsible for the depraved experiment suddenly sees a vision of the mandrake, which morphs through a bright orb of light into the body of Alraune. A similar cinematic strategy is seen in the 1952 version, when a close shot of Alraune’s wide-eyed face fades out of focus into the grotesque form of the mandrake. These special effects, possible only through cinema, gave a new and terrifying dynamism to the old legend’s tale of transformation. Through the medium of film, the mandrake’s horror and ugliness were multiplied when juxtaposed with the beautiful actresses. The films’ fears of certain technologies—such as those that manipulate the human’s biologic fabric—are underscored by the use of cinematographic technologies that show the bad metamorphosis of humans in a cautionary way, without actually transforming them. A certain strain of Germanic culture could be described as an earth cult, and this obsession in the twentieth century with the mandrake and the Wurzelmännchen confirms <a id="p35" class="page1"></a>a residual paganism and a resistance to modernity, which represents a threat again the natural order of the world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The root is a foul and base thing, associated with abjection, filth, and taboo. When Samuel Beckett wrote in a letter, “All my trees are down in the cold ground where I shudder to think what is happening to their roots,”<a id="fn51r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn51">48</a> he expressed a horror similar to that of Walt Whitman, who, in his poem “This Compost,” puts forth the image of plants and soil as revolting processors of death. Bachelard writes that the root is “its own gravedigger,” the sum of its activity being, in essence, the burial of itself. Furthermore, the plant’s nature is invasive; particularly in the form of weeds, it thrives where there is any bit of soil, even in the cracks of sidewalks or on the roofs of buildings. Roots can drill holes through the most solid human-made structures, turning architectural wonders into ruins.<a id="fn52r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn52">49</a> This green invasion is a fundamental fear of humans, who cannot bear the thought of their accomplishments being swallowed by vegetal lawlessness. Georges Bataille has argued that the root invites a moral projection because of its proximity to dirt; it is reasonable to see in the mandrake an evil and unclean miniature of the human.<a id="fn53r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn53">50</a> It is snakelike, slithering in the depths like the creature that tempted Eve to eat the apple. Julia Kristeva describes as abject all the unbearable phenomena that blur the border between subject and object; what is unacceptably and revoltingly real forces us to reckon with it. Abjection may take the form of putrescence, filth, the repulsive aspects of reproduction and birth, and other taboos to which the human responds in horror; in Sartre’s case, it is the serpentine root that imposes <a id="p36" class="page1"></a>itself on his protagonist in <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i>. Whereas the snake is almost never seen in a positive light, the flexible root image fluctuates between benevolence and malevolence. Bachelard recalls Bacon’s claim that eating roots, seeds, and other edibles imagined to contain a concentrated vitality can rejuvenate people and lengthen their lives (296). During the long winters, roots store essential nutrients, functioning as the plant’s cellar. In some versions of the mandrake tale, it has salvific properties, but these come at a price. Mandrake folklore is one of the best places to look for proof of people’s ambivalence toward the botanical underground. While the flower—with its bright colors, clean forms, and appealing fragrance—lends itself to idealization, the monstrous root invites demonization; and yet the former would not be possible without the latter.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Throughout this book, I return again and again to the themes associated with the mandrake. A small, sexually charged version of ourselves, the miniature root person is both good and evil; it embodies the improbable and the inexplicable; and it is a figure of both life and death simultaneously. In this mythology, one can recognize the attempt to understand a difference that separates the plant from the person: when buried, we are either dead already or we die quickly, but this anthropomorphic root thrives in the suffocating soil. If we try to imagine the first human who pulled up a mandrake and recognized in its roots the shape of a person, we might understand the horror and shock of seeing a miniature, buried self that thrives in a state of inhumation. This alter ego, spawned from the seed of malefactors, is paradoxically full of life and able to impart some of its life to the person who finds it. Particularly in Sartre’s treatment of the root, we recognize the mandrake legend refashioned for an intellectual and enlightened audience. But Enlightenment does not shine brightly enough to diminish the root’s dark and age-old connotations.</p>
      <p class="sec">*</p>
      <p class="pf">This introductory chapter has laid the groundwork for those to come. It is essential to understand from the beginning that the root is more than just one metaphor among many. As a figure for the subconscious and for the deep cognitive mechanisms that govern figurative language, the root gives voice to human anxieties about ecological alienation, geographic exile, cultural transmission, and genetic inheritance. The flexible metaphor accommodates both science and mysticism; as will become clear in the following chapters, the tug-of-war between these two ways of thinking has tested the plasticity of the root metaphor. Its most astounding development, analyzed in the final pages of this book, takes shape in the very recent claim that humans and plants <a id="p37" class="page1"></a>share a cellular consciousness, thus annulling the metaphoricity of centuries-old depictions of plants as humans and vice versa. Scholars in philosophy, botany, and anthropology are drawing closer to a conclusion that the idea of a botanical human was never a metaphor. This literalization, made now through scientifically legitimated discourses, closely resembles early paganistic approximations between plant and person. But if the claims are the same, does it matter through which discourse they are made?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the following chapter, we see how poets have used the root to thematize filiation, environmental estrangement, regional embeddedness, and the process of thinking. Because it welcomes metaphor and has no need to disguise it, poetry is perhaps the most sanctioned and innocuous place for this kind of figurative language. Only when metaphor hides or erases its metaphoricity does it become dangerous. The inherent subjectivity of the poetic voice turns poems into experimental sites where impressionistic thoughts are safely formulated. Perhaps new metaphorizations must be tried out in poetry first before they are allowed to enter the realm of the political.</p>
