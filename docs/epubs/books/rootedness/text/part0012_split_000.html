      <p class="pf"><a class="page1"></a>“Philosophy can take root only in radical reflexion upon the meaning and possibility of its own scheme”: This was Edmund Husserl’s formulation to describe the aims of phenomenology.<a id="fn312r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn312">1</a> Alternating between root, ground, and foundation, European phenomenologists of the twentieth century tried out various metaphors to describe their central claim, namely that the consciousness of phenomena always happens through a perceiving subject. Thought and perception have a “home base,” so to speak, but a self-veiling one; the elision of this fact, perhaps at one time the most common elision in philosophy, prevents a full account of the way a thought is formulated. In an effort to underscore this fundamental fact, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others deploy the root metaphor specifically to describe how a better understanding of consciousness from a first-person perspective can be reached by turning to a seemingly reliable source of experience: the phenomena themselves as discerned by the subject. They hoped to reembody or reroot consciousness in a stable locus: the perceiving mind.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This chapter begins with a close reading of Sartre’s <i class="calibre1">La nausée</i>, with particular focus on the famous root scene, which gives a radical form to the troubling impenetrability of existence. Sartre’s choice of the metaphor was not arbitrary; the root and the tree hold a highly charged personal significance for him, as I will show in his letters, journals, and philosophical texts such as <a id="p156" class="page1"></a><i class="calibre1">Being and Nothingness</i> and <i class="calibre1">Truth and Existence</i>. Furthermore, Sartre’s interest in the root and in “rooted phenomena” is consistent with the phenomenologists’ ambitious project of (re)grounding philosophy as a discipline. I conclude with pertinent examples from the canon of phenomenological texts by thinkers like Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and Heidegger, which reveal that their use of the root metaphor is not simply a rhetorically interesting way to say “origin.” Their selection of a living, grounded form that connotes the essential quality of something is careful and meaningful. I show how rootedness and, alternatively, groundedness, are the organizing metaphors for phenomenological thought.</p>
