      <p class="pf">When Anthony Steinbock states, “Verticality is the vector of mystery and reverence; horizontality is what is in principle within reach, graspable, controllable,”<a id="fn149r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn149">4</a> he points toward a tradition in Western thought that associates upright orientation with the sacred and lateral orientation with the banal and the worldly. God is not laterally accessible; the locus of the holy is over our heads. As Pierre-Henri Hadot notes, the Greek tradition that connects contemplation with looking upward toward the stars participates in the pattern of verticality associated with the relationship of the human to the divine.<a id="fn150r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn150">5</a> <a id="p79" class="page1"></a>Perhaps the Greeks’ conception of the soul as breath (pneuma [πνεύμα]) accounts in part for the lightness, invisibility, and upwardness found in Western notions of spirituality. Phenomenologist Erwin Straus attributes this pattern to the human’s exceptional upright posture and to the lengthy period and strenuous exertion necessary for a human child to begin to move about in the world vertically. Unlike breath or the heartbeat, which function automatically, sitting, standing, and walking upright are challenges to be met. The physical burden of gravity is thus transposed into a metaphysical challenge in the human subconscious.<a id="fn151r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn151">6</a> In Straus’s convincing account, verticality as transcendence is deeply <a id="p80" class="page1"></a>embedded in language and is experientially grounded. He writes, “When we lower our heads or kneel in prayer, when we bow or bend our knees in greeting, the deviation from the vertical reveals the relation to it” (146). That is, by showing reverence and lowering ourselves before the divine, we are signaling a self-relegation and yielding to the greater power. The degree of our lowness stands in proportionate contradistinction to the degree of respect toward the vertical sacred.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christian Froidefond notes that “the notion of verticality is often associated with the notion of stability”<a id="fn152r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn152">7</a> and, perhaps more significantly, that “verticality implies the action of a <i class="calibre1">force</i>, whether the growth of plants, the erection of a column, [or] the vertical bearing of certain animals” (257–58). In these examples, as in Straus’s view, upwardness requires a challenge to gravity, leading one to make the more generalized argument that any physical resistance, including that of gravity, may be depicted figuratively as a spiritually meaningful challenge or burden. To meet challenges is to engage in the assertion of self against an opposing force. The tree’s defiance of gravity by means of its stabilizing root structure can easily be metaphorized as a figure for the human’s upward struggle, against gravity and through the elements, toward transcendence. These claims are consonant with the examples previously given here of why the vertical axis is of such importance in considerations of the divine. This pattern, that what is up is simultaneously unknown and superior to us, is confirmed over the centuries, from early philosophical texts to twentieth-century phenomenological studies and conceptual metaphor studies.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Straus makes a further claim about the ways in which verticality nuances the conception of human as autonomous individual and how this nuance is ultimately detrimental to the idea of community. In a community, verticality as a posture means a collection of parallel lines that never touch.<a id="fn153r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn153">8</a> If we follow the analogy of human as tree and community as forest, there remains an irreconcilable <a id="p81" class="page1"></a>separation between people despite their clustering together in collectives, in Straus’s view. While one is able to dwell among others, a real contact with other humans is impossible without bowing oneself or bending toward one’s neighbor. The verticals in a cluster remain alone together. Francis Ponge also noted this vertical isolation of pine trees and personified them in his “Le carnet du bois de pins,” wondering whether the trees, despite their separation above ground, maintained the same autonomy in their roots.<a id="fn154r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn154">9</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Georges Bataille, in his essay “The ‘Old Mole’ and the Prefix <i class="calibre1">Sur</i> in the Words <i class="calibre1">Surhomme</i> [Superman] and <i class="calibre1">Surrealist</i>,” a sustained reflection on the high and the low, claims that the human resembles a plant in its perpendicularity to the ground and that the human’s uprightness has symbolically moral implications. The plant thrusts itself willingly toward the abject soil, which is equally tempting to the human and which stands in opposition to “spiritual elevation.” In the introduction of his well-known essay “The Big Toe,” he claims that the big toe separates the human from apes and that the human foot provides the necessary conditions for our erect posture. He insists on the ambivalent relationship people maintain with the ground, which represents all that is low and filthy, the place whence we came but which provides the necessary ground for our vertical transcendence. Our resistance to the ground and our antigravitational struggle away from it is ultimately undone by death, when we sink back into the earth and become it, through the process of decomposition.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In French, the translation of the expression “upright” is <i class="calibre1">droit</i>, which is also the word for “law” (<i class="calibre1">le droit civil</i>) and “right” (<i class="calibre1">les droits de l’homme et du citoyen</i>). As Christian Froidefond has shown, the association between rectilinearity and moral rightness was already firmly in place in Plato’s time. The root <i class="calibre1">orthos</i>, which exists in contemporary terms such as “orthodox” (“right opinion”), is difficult to render in Latin, French, or English. The corresponding approximations in each language (<i class="calibre1">verus, vrai, true</i>) fall short of the original meaning, which included simultaneously the notions of the rectilinear and the vertical.<a id="fn155r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn155">10</a> Froidefond draws a fascinating analogy between the words <i class="calibre1">orthos</i> and <i class="calibre1">plagios</i>, equating the first with verticality and the second with horizontality. While what is orthodox is associated with uprightness and rectitude, the <a id="p82" class="page1"></a>root <i class="calibre1">plagios</i> finds its way into the word “plagiarism,” literary thievery, with <i class="calibre1">plagios</i> transforming from its connotation of flatness and spread-out-ness to the snare that is laid out to catch an animal. The plagiarist thus sets out a trap and snatches up the work of another, or catches readers themselves in his or her deception. The horizontality of <i class="calibre1">plagios</i> comes to represent underhandedness and deceit. Many have noted that in the left-right dichotomy, right is good and left is bad. This is most apparent in French, with <i class="calibre1">gauche</i> meaning left but also awkward or lacking grace of speech or movement. In Italian, right is <i class="calibre1">destra</i> and left is <i class="calibre1">sinistra</i>, which exists also in languages such as English (<i class="calibre1">sinister</i>) and French (<i class="calibre1">sinistre</i>), meaning wicked or ominous. Thus, that which is not upright or on its way to being so is necessarily encoded in the Western imagination as evil or wrong.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These abundant examples illustrate the extent to which metaphors of transcendence are experientially based and latent in language. A debate whether transcendence is an anthropologically or theologically determined human universal was triggered by René Girard’s controversial <i class="calibre1">Deceit, Desire, and the Novel</i> (<i class="calibre1">Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque</i>, 1961). Girard puts the novel form and Christian transcendence in dialogue, arguing that the novel, which began as a solidly European tradition, relies on specific elements of Christian symbolism. He claims that “Christian symbolism is universal for it alone is able to give form to the experience of the novel.”<a id="fn156r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn156">11</a> This symbolism primarily takes form as a pattern of transcendence inherent to the novelistic narrative. He goes on to explain, “Repudiation of a human mediator and renunciation of deviated transcendency inevitably call for symbols of vertical transcendency whether the author is Christian or not” (312). Many have disputed Girard’s contentious claim; for example, Andrew McKenna argues that the desire for transcendence is an experientially informed, anthropological fact,<a id="fn157r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn157">12</a> which aligns with Straus’s claims that our bodily condition as humans predated and informed our subsequent relationship with the (imagined) divine. One of the novelist’s skills consists in creating the illusion of telling with uncanny accuracy what we ourselves <a id="p83" class="page1"></a>have experienced. What remains unclear is whether this consonance between verticality and the novelistic narrative is a specifically Western phenomenon or if this pattern can be found in similar types of narratives in non-Western civilizations. It is nearly impossible to determine a causal relationship between the two, but the fact remains that transcendent verticality is a pattern simultaneously present in Christian narrative (the Bible, hagiographies, etc.) and in the novel form. In other words, Christianity and the novel were originally both vertically, not horizontally, oriented.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But how does one ascend, either spiritually or intellectually, as a collective or as an individual? What are the prerequisites for an upward-moving life or afterlife? I argue that in the Western imagination, the often overlooked precondition for transcendence is rootedness or groundedness. In other words, verticality depends on a measure of horizontality, weight, and tenacity at holding one’s ground. Such rootedness or groundedness takes many forms but is the consistent precondition for the varieties of transcendence described above.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The tree, whose verticality relies on its subterranean moorings, has remained a symbolically charged figure in Europe throughout the centuries. As Bachelard wrote, “The tree is a stabilizer, a model of uprightness and firmness.”<a id="fn158r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn158">13</a> Imagined as the bearer of the fruit that occasioned the fall of man, the Tree of Knowledge connects the arboreal and the epistemological in a single concept, a connection that has persisted throughout the centuries. In the seventeenth century, Descartes created a similar schema called the Tree of Philosophy, whose roots were metaphysics, whose trunk was physics, and whose branches were the other sciences, including medicine, mechanics, and morals.<a id="fn159r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn159">14</a> In genealogy and the natural sciences, the tree became an essential schematic structure for depicting the relationships between people or other organic life-forms, thus organizing knowledge in a visually comprehensible way.<a id="fn160r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn160">15</a></p>
