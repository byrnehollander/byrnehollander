      <p class="pf">Inspired by his mentor and former teacher Paul Valéry, who had taken interest in the plant as a figure for the life of the mind, Michel Tournier (1924–) uses the inverted plant as a figure for metaphysical transformation in his novel <i class="calibre1">Friday</i> (<i class="calibre1">Vendredi, ou les limbes du Pacifique</i>, 1967), which won the Grand prix du roman de l’Académie française. Tournier was also a student of Gaston Bachelard, who wrote extensively on the subconscious associations expressed through the figure of the root, as outlined in <a class="page1" href="part0008_split_000.html#ch01">chapter 1</a>. With these precedents in mind and with a solid background in philosophy, Tournier set out to model the change he believed possible in the European mind, using a canonical European literary figure to do so. His retelling of Defoe’s <i class="calibre1">Robinson Crusoe</i> recounts the shipwreck and arrival of the protagonist Robinson on a deserted island off the coast of Chile, an island he later names Speranza. The tale alternates between third- and first-person narration in the form of a log-book of Robinson’s reflections about his experiences on the island. The log-book as reflective venue is borrowed directly from Valéry’s Teste, who recorded his thoughts in the same format. Because Tournier had studied philosophy before turning to writing many years later, heavily philosophical concepts are omnipresent in the narrative, particularly in Robinson’s meditations.<a id="fn201r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn201">56</a> In the early stages of his arrival, he attempts to “civilize” the island despite the lack of other people on it, his only companion being a dog that had survived the shipwreck. He creates, for example, a charter for the island and a penal code. Furthermore, he repeats in a compressed time span a series of civilizational developments: <a id="p104" class="page1"></a>history (he keeps a log-book), cartography (he makes a map), time-keeping (he keeps a calendar and builds a clypsedra, or water clock), religion (he reads the Bible and performs various Christian rituals). The narrator explains, “After cultivating the soil of the island, he had now given it the beginnings of a dairy herd. Like mankind at the dawn of history, he had passed through the stage of hunting and gathering into that of tilling and stock raising.”<a id="fn202r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn202">57</a> In short, he becomes the administrator of the island. This administrative obsession protects him from what he perceives as the chaos of the island and its nature. However, the discrepancy he notices between “l’île administrée” and “l’<i class="calibre1">autre île</i>”<a id="fn203r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn203">58</a> foretells his conversion to come:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">For if on the surface of the island I pursue the work of civilization—tillage, stockbreeding, building, administering, lawgiving—which follows the pattern of human society and is therfore in a sense retrospective, I feel that in myself I am the scene of a more radical process of creation, one which is engaged in finding new and original substitutes for the ruins that solitude has left with me, all more or less tentative and so to speak experimental, but bearing less and less resemblance to the human model from which they sprang.<a id="fn204r" class="fnref1" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn204">59</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">It is essential to note Robinson’s word choice in the expressions “solutions originales” and “l’évolution plus radicale” in this excerpt from his log-book. In contemporary contexts of theory and politics, the connection between “radical” and “root” is often elided. Does radicality involve an acknowledgment and appreciation of an original state and the celebration of a return to it? Or does it involve the total eradication of an institution and a subsequent replanting of it? Is radical simply a synonym for extreme, fundamental, essential, total? Why is radicality most often associated with Leftist movements? Because it is the opposite of conservatism, the will to preserve? In Tournier’s case, the term suggests a total overhaul of his protagonist’s existential habits. Robinson’s transformation throughout the novel involves a return to what is fundamental, what is <i class="calibre1">élémentaire</i>, an adjective used in the book to signify a reconfiguration of the basic units of existence and the conversion from a telluric to a solar being.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Robinson’s first contact with humans after the shipwreck occurs when Araucanian Indians from Chile arrive on Speranza in order to conduct ritual sacrifices. Although Tournier does not use it, the word <i class="calibre1">autochtone</i> is often <a id="p105" class="page1"></a>used in French to designate indigenous people. The word can be traced to the Greek root <i class="calibre1">khthon</i> (earth) and means “one sprung from the soil he or she inhabits.” This etymology points to an analogy between the plant and the human as entities born from the soil. The tree is often conceived as a bridge between the Chthonic (underworld) and the Uranic (celestial sphere), and Tournier incorporated these notions directly into his novel. When the Auracanians return for another ritual, one of them is spontaneously selected for sacrifice, one who “was also darker-skinned and somewhat Negroid in feature, in general different from the other men” (134). When Robinson’s dog Tenn, his sole companion, barks, thus drawing attention to Robinson from his hiding place, he decides that the best course of action is to shoot the designated sacrifice victim, who had managed to escape during the distraction caused by the bark. The dog deviates Robinson’s aim, causing him to kill one of the pursuants instead. From that moment on, Robinson has a new human companion—the man who narrowly escaped being sacrificed. He gives him the name Vendredi (Friday), after the day on which he saved him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Vendredi is the conduit by which Robinson’s conversion is made possible. Through a series of initiations, Robinson moves from the earthly to the solar, in essence emptying his head stuffed “with the trappings of three thousand years of Western civilization” (135). At the end of his conversion, he recognizes Vendredi’s role, writing in his log-book: “Friday forced me to make a more radical conversion,”<a id="fn205r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn205">60</a> one that required him to couple literally with the island Speranza, making love to the soil and the plants as though they were the sex of a woman and descending deep into her womb, a cave from which he is eventually reborn. He later called this timeless period of descent into the cave “the earth-bound phase of his life” and his “his long sojourn underground.”<a id="fn206r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn206">61</a> In his time in the depths of the earth, Speranza transforms into mother, recalling the primordial origins of humans, having sprung from the earth. Robinson even comes to understand that the vertigo produced in humans when they climb trees or cliffs is a result of the terrestrial nature of the human, who is stubbornly bound to its element of origin.<a id="fn207r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn207">62</a> In his log-book, he writes of the experience of <a id="p106" class="page1"></a>quitting the cave: “It is written that we cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven except with the humility of a child. Never was any word of the Scriptures more literally true. The cave not only affords me the unshakable rock on which I may rest my poor life; it is a return to the lost innocence which all men secretly mourn. It unites as by a miracle the peace of the sweet maternal darkness and the peace of the grave, the one before, the other after life” (107). Again, transcendence can be accessed only through the rootedness of self. As Anthony Steinbock writes, “It is by virtue of the Earth’s function as ground that the lived-body can be self-giving and such that transcendent objects can be given at all.”<a id="fn208r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn208">63</a> Here, in a nostalgia for the matrix, Robinson reroots himself in the original soil, returning to an embryonic state. Only this telluric embeddedness, which he believes to be confirmed by the Gospel, can create the conditions for his vertical ascent and solar metamorphosis.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">After this revelation, he embarks on a different educative path, what he eventually calls the <i class="calibre1">voie végétale</i>, the botanical way or path.<a id="fn209r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn209">64</a> The narrator reflects, “Was [Robinson] the last member of the human race to return to the vegetative sources of life?”<a id="fn210r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn210">65</a> In an evolving series of personified depictions of plants and trees, he begins to find them sexually attractive. After coupling for several months with a fallen <i class="calibre1">quillai</i> or soapbark tree, he is bitten one day by a spider while in the act and interprets this as a symbolic venereal disease and a sign that “the ‘vegetable way’ might be no more than a dangerous blind alley” (116). Despite the warning, he pursues his botanical intercourse. In his explorations on the island, he discovers a pink valley or combe, <i class="calibre1">une combe rose</i>, that attracts him.<a id="fn211r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn211">66</a> He begins to reflect on the word <i class="calibre1">combe</i>, which triggers another word, <i class="calibre1">lombes</i>, or “loins,” in his mind, the pink valley thus transforming as both image and word into a sexualized sign. Readers might also make the connection between <i class="calibre1">lombes</i> and the <i class="calibre1">limbes</i> of the title, which means “limbo” or the plural “limbs.” In a complex set of associations between love (Eros) and death (Thanatos), Robinson decides that both are of an earthly nature (“de nature tellurique” [133]), because the earth welcomes lovers falling together in passion and the bodies of the dead. Robinson recounts his coupling with <a id="p107" class="page1"></a>the ground: “I dug my grave with my sex and died the transient death we call pleasure. And I note that in doing so I have accomplished a further stage in the metamorphosis I am undergoing. . . . [I]n the pink coomb my sexuality returned to its original source, the earth.”<a id="fn212r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn212">67</a> After coupling with the earth, he notices that a new species of plant has sprung up exactly where he left his seed. He gently unearths one of the plants to discover the following: “It was true! His love-making with Speranza was not sterile. The white, fleshy, curiously forked root bore an undeniable resemblance of the body of a woman-child” (129). This mandrake child does not produce fertility, like the examples seen in <a class="page1" href="part0008_split_000.html#ch01">chapter 1</a>; it is rather the <i class="calibre1">result</i> of fertility. He notices furthermore that after his night of sleep lying on the ground, his beard had begun to take root in the soil.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">His conversion is most clearly portrayed in the figure of the inverted plant. Friday disappears for a couple of days, and, out of concern, Robinson sets out to find him. He happens upon a “secret world,” a kind of ritual space composed of masks, snakeskins, bodies of dead birds, and other objects. Friday has replanted plants upside down and disguised himself as a plant. Through the metaphor of these inverted plants, Friday foretells Robinson’s conversion: an abandonment of the European values that had birthed him and the adoption of a more radical, elementary system of values. Upon its publication, Tournier’s novel resonated with the public for reasons beyond his literary prowess. The text was well received because of its absolute relevance to the sociopolitical climate of the time. By the 1960s, France had lost most of its colonies, and the turmoil of decolonization destabilized long-held beliefs of the supremacy of the <i class="calibre1">métropole</i> in relation to the extrahexagonal peoples it had governed. In addition, in its effort to replenish a depleted workforce, France sought out a new working class that it might import from the colonies to keep the nation competitive. This measure had been conceived as a temporary solution; after the immigrants helped France to recover economically, it was presumed that they would somehow simply vanish, returning happily to the place whence they’d come. Tournier’s novel obliquely addresses these predicaments, which had not yet found a productive articulation in public discourse. By recrafting Defoe’s tale of that most European of Europeans, Robinson Crusoe—with his mercantilist ambition, his Christian certainty, and his administrative compulsion—Tournier clearly attempts to compensate through literature for the injustices dealt by Europe to its colonies. His novel certainly would have had less impact had he invented completely new characters without a long, <a id="p108" class="page1"></a>influential cultural presence. Other than Montaigne’s <i class="calibre1">Essais</i>, Defoe’s <i class="calibre1">Crusoe</i> is perhaps one of the only texts that has spawned its own prodigious genre, the robinsonade. In Tournier’s book, the Other as embodied by Friday is humanized in an unprecedented way. His influence on Crusoe is superior to that of Crusoe on him. He imposes his reality on Crusoe and the (French) reader. No longer a virtual, imagined subject across the globe, exoticized, zoomorphized, infantilized, reduced, and belittled, Friday is at your doorstep, urging to be dealt with through his mere presence. One possible answer to such an imposition of the real is total and deliberate conversion, a reconsideration of the universality of European values.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When Crusoe comes across Friday’s shrine, he is shocked to find that nature has accepted the inversion imposed upon it. Because Friday has made his own body into that of a plant, he illustrates even more clearly to Crusoe that the inverted plants are not simply figures for themselves but figures for human convertibility. By analogizing his own body as plant, he makes clear that the human is a changeable creature. While the European had convinced himself that the only path to transcendence—specifically Christian transcendence—involved the strict observance of principles and commandments clearly given by the Scripture and predicated on the superiority of his race, suddenly a very different kind of transcendence is made available to him. Still vertical in nature, since his elemental conversion leads him upward toward the sun, this new iteration of transcendence is compatible with the lives of Others. Without the self-imposed Eurocentric white man’s burden, Robinson finds a sudden lightness as he ascends toward his solar future. Tournier is essentially turning European culture back on itself through a maneuver of inversion. By playing out an alternate course of events in the hypothetical space of fiction, he undermines the European values extolled by Defoe’s canonical realist novel. Rather than making his point with his own narrative and characters, Tournier found a much more effective conduit for a collective <i class="calibre1">prise de conscience</i> by tipping on its head an established literary artifact with a centuries-long resonance.</p>
      <p class="sec">*</p>
      <p class="pf">In these examples from Aristotle to Tournier and in disciplines such as natural science, philosophy, and literature, the inversions most often imply or make specific an analogy between human and plant. That one is taken for the other is a commonplace since antiquity. I have shown how the same figure in various fields confirms that, while transcendence is predicated on rootedness, the human does have the capacity to invert what was accepted as the proper course <a id="p109" class="page1"></a>of nature in an improvisational adaptation to unforeseen change. In some instances, this analogy takes the form of a mechanistic comparison of bodily functions: the plant’s roots are like the human feet, stomach, or head. In other cases, the human and the plant are considered more holistically, both having an ingrained vital will that accounts for their survival and growth. Even the most catastrophic event, a reversal of ground and sky, can be survived and perhaps welcomed as an occasion for positive change. The inverted-plant figure is often associated with the reflective life of the human. Because the proliferation of knowledge is frequently depicted as plant growth, the inverted plant can mean a change of mind. For the Encyclopédistes, it stands as a motif for the kinds of exceptional philosophical experiments that should be undertaken in the service of secular humanism. To ponder the previously imponderable is the task of the good thinker. Inversion for the thinker is not a violence; it is a pedagogical necessity for the spread of radical thought. That inverted plant-man Monsieur Teste is another who thinks “autrement,” subverting social codes and the norms of how one is permitted to think. This anomaly thrives with his roots in the air, a curiosity to anyone who comes in contact with him. But as a witness (<i class="calibre1">testis</i>) to the other side, his self-imposed task of intellectual maturation leaves him exiled from the sphere of the social. After all, his entourage and those strangers with whom he comes into contact in the garden and on the streets have only seen one side of things. They are embedded in their way of knowing. Of all the examples, the story of Robinson-as-convert is the most provocative and politically relevant to its contemporaries. While the Encyclopédistes were certainly interested in upending the dominant patterns of thought among their compatriots, Tournier pits European culture against itself by reversing an endorsed canonical tale of European superiority. The inversion of the plants is a miniature tableau of what the entire novel attempts to do: flip the system of value to show its arbitrariness and unsustainability as grounded truth. Through metaphors of inversion and conversion, Tournier illustrates the very concrete problems touching the book’s first readers. Unstable soil precludes both rootedness and transcendence.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As I have shown in this chapter, rootedness was a notion that first attached the human to the divine, then to the earth. In the early depictions cited, particularly Plato’s, the soul of the human was automatically rooted in the divine, by birth and by nature. The ecocentric paganism of antiquity was compatible with this divine rootedness; Man had not yet “fallen.” However, in the Christian imagination, the celestial is no longer a given for the human; rootedness to the earth was the condition into which Man was born, and his life was spent in the service of an active transcendence of these terrestrial roots. <a id="p110" class="page1"></a>Paradise was no longer granted by birth; it was to be earned. Furthermore, during the progressive sedentarization of the human, from the early moments of agriculture-based subsistence to the coalescence of the nation-state, the soil gained new symbolically charged connotations as the ground into which people could root themselves. This progression marks the increasingly deep schism between the <i class="calibre1">nomades</i> and the <i class="calibre1">sédentaires</i>, between rooted populations and unrooted ones. In the next chapter, we see how the connection between rootedness and transcendence presented dire consequences for those, particularly immigrants and Jews, who were perceived to be unrooted and unrootable in the national soil. In France, the prerequisite for acceptance among the proud descendants of “nos ancêtres les Gaulois” was a condition that could never be met: a demonstrable genetic, geographic, and cultural heritage of <i class="calibre1">francité</i> that could be neither bought, stolen, nor earned. And in Germany, where <i class="calibre1">Blut</i> was bound to <i class="calibre1">Boden</i>, proof of rootedness became the basic condition for survival.</p>
