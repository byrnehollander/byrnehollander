      <p class="pf">Sartre stands alongside Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and others as a pioneer in phenomenological thought. Phenomenology is sympathetic to the search for a philosophical ground from which thought should depart. So, while Deleuze and Guattari have argued that German philosophy is unique in its constant need to clear and consolidate a ground and to “lay foundations,”<a id="fn358r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn358">47</a> the French were apparently as tempted by the phenomenological project to reground philosophy in a perceiving subject. This discipline takes interest in structures of consciousness as perceived and experienced from the first-person perspective. Phenomenology is less invested in reality than in the way a seeming reality manifests itself. For this reason, the perceiving subject and the phenomena that filter through the individual become the site of inquiry and the ground from which one can build a new understanding of consciousness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What are the differences between groundedness and rootedness? Most obviously, in the fusion of earth and plant, groundedness focuses on the earth’s role in this fusion while rootedness focuses on the plant’s. From the perspective of groundedness, the earth plays the active role of holding and stabilizing <a id="p172" class="page1"></a>what is embedded in it, while from the perspective of rootedness, the plant clutches the soil, taking “responsibility” for its own uprightness. Furthermore, groundedness has other connotations, for example the notion of an electrical groundedness that allows currents to safely dissipate without risk of shock. To ground a child is to prevent his flight after disobedience, to preclude future disobediences. To be grounded is to be practical and level-headed, to have found a cosmic balance, to have established a solid base on which to build all activity and thought. To be rooted is to be anchored—for better or for worse—to a site. Those who are fearful are rooted to the spot. Rootedness allows one to tap into a collective history and to make use of the stores of accumulated cultural energy. While rootedness and groundedness have distinct connotations, they do have some shared meanings and are frequently used interchangeably.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Although proponents of phenomenology don’t always use the root metaphor explicitly, their gesture is one of a turning toward the ground of experience. Many of these thinkers, however, do rely on the metaphorical potential of the root to express this shift in Western philosophy. I have shown how Heidegger appropriates and transforms Descartes’s root metaphor to construct his own definition of metaphysics, but other phenomenologists rely on roots as well to describe what they believe philosophy should do. For example, Max Scheler argues uncompromisingly, “Every kind of cognition is rooted in experience.”<a id="fn359r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn359">48</a> In Husserl’s introduction to the English translation of his <i class="calibre1">Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology</i> [<i class="calibre1">Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie</i>], he writes that philosophy must become self-conscious of its own roots.<a id="fn360r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn360">49</a> In addition to a specifically <a id="p173" class="page1"></a>root-related vocabulary (“root,” “radical,” “embedded,” “radicalism”), Husserl deploys several synonymous expressions for rootedness: “absolute basis,” “foundation,” “matrix,” “start,” “first beginning,” “groundwork,” “original,” and “firmness of basis.” The “original self-activity” he describes involves recouching consciousness in the body, which creates the preliminary conditions for its very possibility. Later, in his <i class="calibre1">Cartesian Meditations</i>, Husserl makes a similar assertion: “Philosophy . . . demands an elucidation by virtue of the <i class="calibre1">ultimate</i> and <i class="calibre1">most concrete</i> essential rootedness of any Objective world in transcendental subjectivity and thus make [<i class="calibre1">sic</i>] the world intelligible concretely: <i class="calibre1">as a constituted sense</i>.”<a id="fn361r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn361">50</a> He considers the objective certainty of positivist thought to be misleading and seeks instead an absolute point of departure, an unmitigated and stable position that takes into account the relevance of human experience. Philosophy itself must be taken to task. Without this first step—the clearing away of assumptions about how philosophical thought should operate—philosophers are doomed to remain in a faulty circuit that disregards the body and subjective experience, their task remaining thus incomplete. As David Abram describes eloquently: “The earth is thus, for Husserl, the secret depth of the life-world. . . . In his words, the earth is the encompassing ‘ark of the world,’ the common ‘root basis’ of all relative life worlds. Husserl’s late insights into the importance of the earth for all human cognition were . . . to have profound implications for the subsequent unfolding of phenomenological philosophy.”<a id="fn362r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn362">51</a> Merleau-Ponty takes a similar position in his <i class="calibre1">Signs</i> (<i class="calibre1">Signes</i>, 1960) when he writes, “Reflection is no longer the passage from another order that absorbs that of actual things; it is first a more acute consciousness of our rootedness in them.”<a id="fn363r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn363">52</a> This attitude is manifest already in the moment of Merleau-Ponty’s earliest public engagement. In his application statement for entry into the Collège de France, he insists on the “rootedness of mind <i class="calibre1">in its body</i> and <i class="calibre1">in its world</i>.”<a id="fn364r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn364">53</a> In his <i class="calibre1">Phenomenology of Perception</i> (<i class="calibre1">Phénoménologie</i> <a id="p174" class="page1"></a><i class="calibre1">de la perception</i>, 1945), he also describes perception in terms of the perceiving mind’s grip (<i class="calibre1">la prise</i>) of the phenomena it encounters. The concept of grip, also implied in the etymology of <i class="calibre1">comprehend</i>, is suggestive of the relationship of the root to its environment, the way the plant clutches the earth for support. In English, the term <i class="calibre1">awareness</i> is less active than its French counterpart, <i class="calibre1">prise de conscience</i>, which implies a taking or gripping of consciousness. In his later thought, Merleau-Ponty developed the notion of flesh (<i class="calibre1">la chair</i>), which he viewed as a necessary addition to the four elements, as it is the only vital, living element.<a id="fn365r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn365">54</a> Without it, the planet remains a dead one. As Sally Fischer has read this development in his thought, “Merleau-Ponty’s concept of ‘flesh’ is an attempt to <i class="calibre1">root</i> his previous phenomenology in its fleshy (ontological) soil and to radicalize his critique of dualism by thinking anew the space between the subjectivist and objectivist alternatives.”<a id="fn366r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn366">55</a> The phenomenologists’ metaphor of the body as site of the root of consciousness is a variation on the other kinds of human-plant syntheses I present throughout this book. Rather than rooting human consciousness in the ether, as Plato did, the phenomenologists embed it in the body and in lived experience. Some read this groundedness as a figurative “return to the earth,” a new giving of attention to terrestrial concerns, including the well-being of the planet itself. In Charles Brown and Ted Toadvine’s collection <i class="calibre1">Eco-Phenomenology: Back to the Earth Itself</i>, they argue that “phenomenology, as a contemporary method in philosophy, is particularly well suited to working through some of the dilemmas that have faced environmental ethicists and philosophers of nature.”<a id="fn367r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn367">56</a> They take the phenomenologists’ vocabulary of a “return to the earth” as sympathetic with the goals of the ecological movement.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In an essay called “In Search of the Ground,” the phenomenologist Eric Voegelin argues that a search for ground is common to all civilizations. The metaphysical form of this problem resides in the question, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” He recalls that the etymological root of the word “etiology”—the investigation of the causes of something, often, but not exclusively, a medical term—is <i class="calibre1">aition</i>, “ground” in Greek, which makes etiology “the quest for the ground.” He shows how etiological endeavors that seek <a id="p175" class="page1"></a>original causes and ultimate purposes have changed in nature through the centuries, beginning with foundational Greek thought and proceeding through the new derivatives in contemporary thought. From Voegelin’s analysis, we begin to perceive in a wide range of disciplines (genealogy, medicine, etymology, myth, history) the relentless effort to pinpoint first causes or originary situations by which all futures are framed and determined. He writes: “It all comes back to the question: what is that ultimate purpose toward which we are rationally oriented? This leads us to the question of the nature of man, and to the answer that his nature differentially, as against all other creatures, is openness toward the ground. <i class="calibre1">That</i> is reason: openness toward the ground.”<a id="fn368r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn368">57</a> His very definition of myth describes it as a grounded phenomenon: “<i class="calibre1">Myth</i> can be defined . . . as imputation to other intracosmic things of a ground. It is myth when you tell a story of intracosmic ground” (233). He argues compellingly that the human tries to “misplace” the ground, seeking determinant original causes—everything from libido to race—that justify all human action (wars, sexual deviance, economic collapse). He argues that most of these root causes have simply been “rebranded” and recycled over the centuries, claiming: “We can observe, over the last two hundred years, that every possible locale where one could misplace the ground has been exhausted” (236). Voegelin is right to emphasize the centrality of the notion of groundedness—and, by extension, rootedness—in the twentieth century; few if any thinkers could exempt themselves from taking on this concept in that turbulent period. For Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Voegelin, and other phenomenologists, what is incarnate or embodied seems to be synonymous with what is grounded or “worlded.”<a id="fn369r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn369">58</a> The conditions of being of the earth and of being in the flesh are imbricated notions. If the human, made of <i class="calibre1">humus</i>, did in fact spring figuratively from the earth—let us not forget that Adam was made of clay—the phenomenologists merely seek to remind us of the relationship between consciousness and the world that both created and continues to stimulate it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As I have shown, Sartre’s application of the root metaphor is perhaps the most multifaceted of any of its uses in the canon of twentieth-century French thought. He joins the other phenomenologists in his deployment of it but also makes it very much his own. While in the most famous example, he locates the site of a crisis in Western metaphysics at the root of a chestnut tree, the metaphor works very differently in his other uses of the motif. In <i class="calibre1">Being and</i> <a id="p176" class="page1"></a><i class="calibre1">Nothingness</i>, he depicts rootedness as the opposite of sliding, which he celebrates as a figure for consciousness that manifests itself freely and lightly, like the skier’s grand gesture of appropriating a snow-covered mountain slope. The rootedness he describes as a counterexample of the slide involves a conflation of the self and the self’s surroundings, which constitutes a loss of independence on the part of the conscious mind. So, for Sartre, the tree (a locus of contemplation and confusion) and, more specifically, the root (a locus of crisis, revelation, and radical assimilation) are both figural sites where humans negotiate their place in the world and their status as existing beings.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There are clear biographical indicators that the tree was significant for Sartre in his own life, but this accounts only in part for his repeated use of the root metaphor to convey various aspects of his existential and phenomenological thought. One could speculate that he was simply appropriating an old <i class="calibre1">topos</i>, inherited through philosophers such as Plato, Descartes, and Heidegger, positioning himself as an heir in their line of speculation and attempting to secure a spot in the pantheon of great thinkers by showing how he could take the metaphor and make it his own, adding a new development to philosophy, an old idea in a new key. I would suggest that Sartre’s attraction to fiction plays a central role in his appropriation of the root metaphor. His fiction and nonfiction depictions of human encounters with trees are framed as narratives of meaningful and momentous convergence. For example, when Sartre narrates his contemplation of the plane tree in the Luxembourg Gardens or the chestnut tree in Le Havre, or when he places Roquentin before an oily, twisted root, these are not casual, everyday encounters; they are staged as scenes of revealed knowledge. Most people who look at trees do not perceive these occasions as momentous, but for Sartre, they are instances of revelation. Revelation, a powerful tool exploited by novelists and mystics alike in their narratives, involves the sudden presence of a previously absent knowledge. For Sartre and the phenomenologists, the root is the site, and in some cases the trigger, for a revelation of the unseen or the unacknowledged. Phenomenologists lamented the neglect of the root of consciousness, the blind spot of the philosophy of their time. For this reason, rerooting the human in what it could not or would not see was the objective of Sartre and his contemporaries. Because it is living but inert, because it is perceived as the hidden, primordial aspect of the tree, and because it has no defense against our beholding it, the root is an ideal site for the launching of a discussion about recontextualizing human consciousness in a world that seems to have expelled it. The phenomenologists used the image of a renewed human contact with the lost root to create a compelling case for their take on philosophy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><a id="p177" class="page1"></a>As I’ve shown in this chapter and will pursue in the following chapter, nearly every major philosophical breakthrough in twentieth-century Continental thought confronted the problem of rootedness explicitly. From phenomenology’s subject-centered interrogations regarding ontological roots to the shift from a root-based to a rhizomatic notion of epistemology, from debates regarding the nature of radicality to identity-centered philosophical engagements on the nature of geographic, ethnic, or cultural belonging, twentieth-century European thought organized itself around tropes of rootedness, groundedness, implantation, transplantation, and eradication.</p>
