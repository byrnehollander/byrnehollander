            <p class="ntbqs">And, indeed, God has caused plants to grow with their heads downwards, having fixed their heads in the deepest part of the earth; and having drawn up the heads of the irrational animals from the earth, he has set them up high on long necks, putting their fore feet under their necks as a kind of foundation. But man has received a pre-eminently superior formation. For of all other animals God has bent the eyes downwards, so that they look upon the ground; but on the other hand, he has raised the eyes of man so that he may behold the heaven, being not a terrestrial but a celestial plant as the old proverb is.</p>

On Olympus, high, remote, inaccessible, and exalted, dwell the Homeric gods. On Mount Sinai, Moses receives the Ten Commandments. Below, in the depths, is Hades and the world of shadows. There, also, is the Inferno. However, such evaluations are not unequivocal. “Base” (adjective) and “base” (noun) have, in spite of their phonetic resemblance, different etymological roots and opposite meanings. “Base,” the adjective, is derived from the Latin root <i class="calibre1">bassus</i> with the connotation “short” and, later, “low”; “base,” the noun, originated in the Greek root <i class="calibre1">baino</i>—“walking” or “stepping.” The earth that pulls us downward is also the ground that carries us and gives us support. The weighty man signifies, by his dignified gait, that he carries a heavy burden but sustains it well. Upright posture as counteraction cannot lack the forces against which it strives.</p>

This is the case regardless of whether, with Mme. de Lafayette and Dostoevsky, the writer is a believing Christian, or whether with Proust, Stendhal, and Camus, for instance, he or she is an agnostic or atheist. This is not theological but anthropological revelation, born of experience we can all understand and that the novelist can, by myriad narrative strategies, make us acknowledge as our own.” McKenna, “Rorty,” 306.</p>

          <div class="blockquote">
            <p class="ntbqs">The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connection of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified descendants. . . . As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.</p>

Some examples of her association of the Edenic tree with the cross include these: “The tree of the cross. If we cut down the tree of good and evil, if we renounce making a choice, we then have the cross, the full weight of pure necessity. The illusory power of choice lies at the root of the compensatory imagination which prevents us from being under the full weight of necessity” (Weil, <i class="calibre1">Notebooks</i>, 2:380); “The rooting up of vegetative energy itself and its orientation toward the higher constitutes redemptive suffering. It ransoms creation while unmaking it” (1:255); “The Tree of the World—the eternal fig-tree whose roots have to be severed with the axe of detachment (Gîtâ). This is the vegetative energy. The cross is of wood, but it is made from a tree that has been cut down. Adam ate of the fruit of the tree (Two birds: one of them eats the fruit . . .). The tree must be cut down and one’s own dead body must be its fruit. The vegetative energy has to be uprooted” (1:298); “One must uproot oneself; cut down the tree and make of it a cross, and then carry it always; uproot oneself from the social and vegetative angles; have no native land on this earth that one may call one’s own. To do all that to other people, from the outside, is an ersatz form of de-creation; it is producing unreality. But in uprooting oneself one seeks a greater reality” (1:298). Saint Bonaventura’s thirteenth-century meditation <i class="calibre1">Lignum Vitae</i> imagines the life and death of Christ through a living tree: “Picture in your mind a tree whose roots are watered with an ever-flowing fountain that becomes a great and living river with four channels to water the garden. . . . From the trunk of this tree, imagine that there are growing twelve branches that are adorned with leaves, flowers and fruit. Imagine that the leaves are a most effective medicine to prevent and cure every kind of sickness, because the word of the cross is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.” St. Bonaventura quoted in Carey, <i class="calibre1">Tree</i>, 37–38.</p>

The scene and the letter end with Monsieur Teste’s scoffing at the “ridiculous order” of the garden, with the plants neatly organized and labeled with plaques that list the names of each species. He says of the garden, “This is a garden of epithets . . . a dictionary and cemetery garden” (34).</p>
