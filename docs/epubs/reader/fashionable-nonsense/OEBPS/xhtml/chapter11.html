<p class="ep">Ever since Gödel showed that there does not exist a proof of the consistency of Peano’s arithmetic that is formalizable within this theory (1931), political scientists had the means for understanding why it was necessary to mummify Lenin and display him to the “accidental” comrades in a mausoleum, at the Center of the National Community.</p>

<p class="ep">In applying Gödel’s theorem to questions of the closed and the open, as they relate to sociology then, with one gesture Régis Debray recapitulates and concludes the history and the work of the previous 200 years.</p>

<p class="linespace"> </p>
<p class="co">Gödel’s theorem is an inexhaustible source of intellectual abuses: we have already encountered examples in Kristeva and Virilio, and a whole book could easily be written on the subject. In this chapter we shall give some rather extraordinary examples in which Gödel’s theorem and other concepts taken from the foundations of mathematics are extrapolated in a totally arbitrary way to the social and political domain.</p>
<p class="txs">The social critic Régis Debray devotes one chapter of his theoretical work, <span class="epub-i">Critique of Political Reason,</span> to explain that “collective madness finds its ultimate foundation in a logical axiom that is itself without foundation: <span class="epub-i">incompleteness</span>”.<a href="note.html#chapter11-229" id="cha-229"><span class="epub-sup">229</span></a> This “axiom” (also called “thesis” or “theorem”) is introduced in a rather bombastic fashion:</p>
<p class="ex">The ‘secret’ of our collective miseries, of the a priori condition of any political history, past, present or future, may be stated in a few simple, even childish words. If we bear in mind that surplus labour and the unconscious can both be defined in a single sentence (and that, in the physical sciences, the equation for general relativity can be stated in three letters), there is no danger of confusing simplicity with over-simplification. The secret takes the form of a logical law, an extension of Gödel’s theorem: <span class="epub-i">there can be no organized system without closure and no system can be closed by elements internal to that system alone.</span> (Debray 1983, pp. 169–170, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">Let us pass over the allusion to general relativity. What is more serious is the invocation of Gödel’s theorem, which concerns the properties of certain formal systems in mathematical logic, to explain the “secret of our collective miseries”. There is quite simply no logical relationship between this theorem and questions of sociology.<a href="note.html#chapter11-230" id="cha-230"><span class="epub-sup">230</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">Nevertheless, the conclusions that Debray draws from his “extension of Gödel’s theorem” are rather spectacular. For example:</p>
<p class="ex">Just as it would be a biological contradiction for an individual to give birth to himself (integral cloning as biological aporia?), the government of a collective by itself—<span class="epub-i">verbi gratia</span> ‘of the people by the people’—is a logically contradictory operation (‘generalized workers’ control’ as political aporia). (Debray 1983, p. 177)</p>
<p class="stnis">And likewise:</p>
<p class="ex">It is quite natural that there should be something irrational about groups, for if there were not, there would be no groups. It is positive that there should be something mystical about them, because a demystified society would be a pulverized society. (Debray 1983, p. 176)</p>
<p class="stni">According to Debray, therefore, neither a government of the people by the people nor a demystified society are possible, and this apparently for strictly <span class="epub-i">logical</span> reasons.</p>
<p class="txs">But if the argument were valid, one might as well use it to prove the existence of God, as suggested by the following statement:</p>
<p class="ex">Incompleteness stipulates that a set cannot, by definition, be a substance in the Spinozist sense: something which exists in itself and is conceived by itself. It requires a cause (to engender it) and it is not its own cause. (Debray 1983, p. 177)</p>
<p class="stni">Nevertheless, Debray denies the existence of God (p. 176), without explaining why it would not be an equally “logical” consequence of his “theorem”.</p>
<p class="tx">The bottom line is that Debray never explains what role Gödel’s theorem is supposed to play in his argument. If he wants to employ it directly in reasoning about social organization, then he is simply wrong. If, on the other hand, Gödel’s theorem is intended to serve merely as an analogy, then it could be suggestive but certainly not demonstrative. To support his sociological and historical theses, he would have to supply arguments dealing with humans and their social behavior, not mathematical logic.</p>
<p class="tx">Gödel’s theorem will still be true in ten thousand years or a million years, but no one can say what human society will look like so far in the future. The invocation of this theorem thus gives the appearance of an “eternal” quality to theses that are, at best, valid in a given context and at a given time. Indeed, the allusion to the “biological contradiction” supposedly inherent in “integral cloning” looks nowadays a bit out-of-date—which shows that one must be careful when “applying” Gödel’s theorem.</p>
<p class="txs">Since this idea of Debray does not seem terribly impressive, we were quite surprised to see it elevated to a “Gödel-Debray principle” by the renowned philosopher Michel Serres<a href="note.html#chapter11-231" id="cha-231"><span class="epub-sup">231</span></a>, who explains that</p>
<p class="ex">Régis Debray applies or discovers as applicable to social groups the incompleteness theorem valid for formal systems, and shows that societies can only organize themselves on the express condition that they are founded on something other than themselves, outside their own definition or border. They cannot be sufficient in themselves. He calls this foundation religious. With Gödel he completes the work of Bergson, whose <span class="epub-i">Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion</span> [<span class="epub-i">The Two Sources of Morality and Religion</span>] differentiated between closed and open societies. No, he says, internal coherence is guaranteed by the external: the group only closes if it is open. Saints, geniuses, heroes, paragons and all sorts of champions do not break institutions but make them possible. (Serres 1995, pp. 449–450)</p>
<p class="stnis">He continues:</p>
<p class="exi">Since Bergson, the most notable historians have copied from the <span class="epub-i">Two Sources</span> … Far from copying a model, as they do, Régis Debray solves a problem. Where historians describe the crossing or transgression of social or conceptual limits, without understanding them, because they have borrowed their model ready-made from Bergson, which Bergson constructed on the basis of Carnot and thermodynamics, Régis Debray has constructed his own, and has therefore grasped a new model, based on Gödel and on logical systems.</p>
<p class="exi">This decisive contribution from Gödel and Debray frees us from ancient models and from their repetition. (Serres 1995, p. 450)</p>
<p class="stni">Serres goes on to apply the “Gödel–Debray principle” to the history of science<a href="note.html#chapter11-232" id="cha-232"><span class="epub-sup">232</span></a>, where it is as irrelevant as it is in politics.</p>
<p class="orn">*   *   *</p>
<p class="sb">Our last example is reminiscent of Sokal’s parody, where he plays on the word “choice” to forge an absurd link between the axiom of choice in mathematical set theory<a href="note.html#chapter11-233" id="cha-233"><span class="epub-sup">233</span></a> and the movement for abortion rights. He goes so far as to invoke Cohen’s theorem, which shows that the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis<a href="note.html#chapter11-234" id="cha-234"><span class="epub-sup">234</span></a> are independent (in the technical meaning of this word in logic) of the other axioms of set theory, to claim that conventional set theory is insufficient for a “liberatory” mathematics. Here again, one finds a completely arbitrary leap from the foundations of mathematics to political considerations.</p>
<p class="txs">Since this passage is one of the most openly ridiculous in the parody, we were rather surprised to find similar ideas put forward in utter seriousness—or so it appears—by the philosopher Alain Badiou (in texts that we emphasize are rather old). In <span class="epub-i">Theory of the Subject</span> (1982), Badiou happily throws together politics, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and mathematical set theory. The following excerpt from the chapter entitled “The logic of excess” gives an idea of the book’s flavor. After a brief discussion on the situation of immigrant workers, Badiou refers to the continuum hypothesis and continues (pp. 282–283):</p>
<p class="exi">What is at stake here is nothing less than the fusion of algebra (ordered succession of cardinals) and topology (excess of the partitive over the elementary). The truth of the continuum hypothesis would make law [<span class="epub-i">ferait loi</span>] of the fact that the excess in the multiple has no other assignment than the occupation of the empty place, than the existence of the nonexistent proper of the initial multiple. There would be this maintained filiation of coherence, that what exceeds internally the whole does not go beyond naming the limit point of this whole.</p>
<p class="exi">But the continuum hypothesis is not provable.</p>
<p class="exi">Mathematical triumph of politics over trade-union realism.<a href="note.html#chapter11-235" id="cha-235"><span class="epub-sup">235</span></a></p>
<p class="stni">One cannot help but wonder whether a few paragraphs were inadvertently omitted between the last two sentences of this quote; but no such luck, the jump between mathematics and politics is as abrupt as it appears.<a href="note.html#chapter11-236" id="cha-236"><span class="epub-sup">236</span></a></p>
