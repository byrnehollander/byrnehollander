<p class="ct" id="ch7"><span class="epub-b">7. Intermezzo: Chaos Theory and “Postmodern Science”</span></p>
<p class="ep">The day will come when, by study pursued through several ages, the things now concealed will appear with evidence; and posterity will be astonished that truths so clear had escaped us.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Seneca on the motion of comets, cited by Laplace (1902 [1825], p. 6)</span></p>
<p class="linespace"> </p>
<p class="co">One encounters frequently, in postmodernist writings, the claim that more-or-less recent scientific developments have not only modified our view of the world but have also brought about profound philosophical and epistemological shifts—in short, that the very nature of science has changed.<a href="note.html#chapter7-160" id="cha-160"><span class="epub-sup">160</span></a> The examples cited most frequently in support of this thesis are quantum mechanics, Gödel’s theorem, and chaos theory. But one also finds the arrow of time, self-organization, fractal geometry, the Big Bang, and assorted other theories.</p>
<p class="tx">We think that these ideas are based mostly on confusions, which are, however, much subtler than those of Lacan, Irigaray, or Deleuze. Several books would be needed to disentangle all the misunderstandings and to do justice to the kernels of truth which sometimes lie at their core. In this chapter we shall sketch such a critique, limiting ourselves to two examples: “postmodern science” according to Lyotard, and chaos theory.<a href="note.html#chapter7-161" id="cha-161"><span class="epub-sup">161</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">A by-now-classic formulation of the idea of a profound conceptual revolution can be found in Jean-François Lyotard’s <span class="epub-i">The Postmodern Condition,</span> in a chapter devoted to “postmodern science as the search for instabilities”.<a href="note.html#chapter7-162" id="cha-162"><span class="epub-sup">162</span></a> Here Lyotard examines some aspects of twentieth-century science that indicate, in his view, a transition towards a new “postmodern” science. Let us examine some of the examples he puts forward to support this interpretation.</p>
<p class="txs">After a fleeting allusion to Gödel’s theorem, Lyotard addresses the limits of predictability in atomic and quantum physics. On the one hand, he observes that it is impossible, in practice, to know the positions of all the molecules in a gas, as there are vastly too many of them.<a href="note.html#chapter7-163" id="cha-163"><span class="epub-sup">163</span></a> But this fact is well known, and it has served as the basis for statistical physics since at least the last decades of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, while apparently discussing indeterminism in quantum mechanics, Lyotard uses as an illustration a perfectly classical (non-quantum) example: the density of a gas (the ratio mass/volume). Quoting from a passage in French physicist Jean Perrin’s semi-popular book on atomic physics<a href="note.html#chapter7-164" id="cha-164"><span class="epub-sup">164</span></a>, Lyotard observes that the density of a gas depends upon the scale at which the gas is observed: for example, if one considers a region whose size is comparable to that of a molecule, the density within that region may vary from zero to a very high value, depending on whether a molecule happens to be in that region or not. But this observation is banal: the density, being a macroscopic quantity, is meaningful only when a large number of molecules are involved. Nevertheless, the conceptual conclusions Lyotard draws are rather radical:</p>
<p class="ex">Knowledge about the density of air thus resolves into a multiplicity of absolutely incompatible statements; they can only be made compatible if they are relativized in relation to a scale chosen by the speaker. (Lyotard 1984, p. 57)</p>
<p class="stni">There is a subjectivist tone in this remark, which is not justified by the case at hand. Clearly, the truth or falsity of any statement depends on the meaning of the words used. And when the meaning of those words (like density) depends on the scale, the truth or falsity of the statement will depend on the scale as well. The “multiplicity of statements” on the density of the air, when expressed carefully (i.e., specifying clearly the scale to which the statement refers), are perfectly compatible.</p>
<p class="tx">Later in the chapter, Lyotard mentions <span class="epub-i">fractal geometry,</span> which deals with “irregular” objects such as snowflakes and coastlines. These objects have, in a certain technical sense, a geometrical dimension that is not a whole number.<a href="note.html#chapter7-165" id="cha-165"><span class="epub-sup">165</span></a> In a similar vein, Lyotard invokes <span class="epub-i">catastrophe theory,</span> a branch of mathematics which is devoted, roughly speaking, to classifying the cusps of certain surfaces (and similar objects). These two mathematical theories are certainly interesting, and they have had some applications in the natural sciences, notably in physics.<a href="note.html#chapter7-166" id="cha-166"><span class="epub-sup">166</span></a> Like all scientific advances, they have provided new tools and focussed attention on new problems. But they have in no way called into question traditional scientific epistemology.</p>
<p class="txs">The bottom line is that Lyotard provides no argument to support his philosophical conclusions:</p>
<p class="ex">The conclusion we can draw from this research (and much more not mentioned here) is that the continuous differentiable function<a href="note.html#chapter7-167" id="cha-167"><span class="epub-sup">167</span></a> is losing its preeminence as a paradigm of knowledge and prediction. Postmodern science—by concerning itself with such things as undecidables, the limits of precise control, conflicts characterized by incomplete information, <span class="epub-i">“fracta,”</span> catastrophes, and pragmatic paradoxes—is theorizing its own evolution as discontinuous, catastrophic, nonrectifiable<a href="note.html#chapter7-168" id="cha-168"><span class="epub-sup">168</span></a>, and paradoxical. It is changing the meaning of the word <span class="epub-i">knowledge,</span> while expressing how such a change can take place. It is producing not the known, but the unknown. And it suggests a model of legitimation that has nothing to do with maximized performance, but has as its basis difference understood as paralogy. (Lyotard 1984, p. 60)</p>
<p class="stni">Since this paragraph is frequently quoted, let us examine it closely.<a href="note.html#chapter7-169" id="cha-169"><span class="epub-sup">169</span></a> Lyotard has here thrown together at least six distinct branches of mathematics and physics, which are conceptually quite distant from one another. Moreover, he has confused the introduction of nondifferentiable (or even discontinuous) functions in scientific models with a so-called “discontinuous” or “paradoxical” evolution of science itself. The theories cited by Lyotard of course produce new knowledge, but they do so without changing the meaning of the word.<a href="note.html#chapter7-170" id="cha-170"><span class="epub-sup">170</span></a> <span class="epub-i">A fortiori,</span> what they produce is known, not unknown (except in the trivial sense that new discoveries open up new problems). Finally, the “model of legitimation” remains the comparison of theories with observations and experiments, not “difference understood as paralogy” (whatever this may mean).</p>
<p class="orn">*   *   *</p>
<p class="sb">Let us now turn our attention to chaos theory.<a href="note.html#chapter7-171" id="cha-171"><span class="epub-sup">171</span></a> We shall address three sorts of confusions: those concerning the theory’s philosophical implications, those arising from the metaphorical use of the words “linear” and “nonlinear”, and those associated with hasty applications and extrapolations.</p>
<p class="tx">What is chaos theory about? There are many physical phenomena governed<a href="note.html#chapter7-172" id="cha-172"><span class="epub-sup">172</span></a> by deterministic laws, and therefore predictable in principle, which are nevertheless unpredictable in practice because of their “sensitivity to initial conditions”. This means that two systems obeying the same laws may, at some moment in time, be in very similar (but not identical) states and yet, after a brief lapse of time, find themselves in very different states. This phenomenon is expressed figuratively by saying that a butterfly flapping its wings today in Madagascar could provoke a hurricane three weeks from now in Florida. Of course, the butterfly by itself doesn’t do much. But if one compares the two systems constituted by the Earth’s atmosphere with and without the flap of the butterfly’s wings, the result three weeks from now may be very different (a hurricane or not). One practical consequence of this is that we do not expect to be able to predict the weather more than a few weeks ahead.<a href="note.html#chapter7-173" id="cha-173"><span class="epub-sup">173</span></a> Indeed, one would have to take into account such a vast quantity of data, and with such a precision, that even the largest conceivable computers could not begin to cope.</p>
<p class="tx">To be more precise, let us consider a system whose initial state is imperfectly known (as is always the case in practice). It is obvious that this imprecision in the initial data will be reflected in the quality of the predictions we are able to make about the system’s future state. In general, the predictions will become more inexact as time goes on. But the <span class="epub-i">manner</span> in which the imprecision increases differs from one system to another: in some systems it will increase slowly, in others very quickly.<a href="note.html#chapter7-174" id="cha-174"><span class="epub-sup">174</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">To explain this, let us imagine that we want to reach a certain specified precision in our final predictions, and let us ask ourselves how long our predictions will remain sufficiently accurate. Let us suppose, moreover, that a technical improvement has allowed us to reduce by half the imprecision of our knowledge of the initial state. For the first type of system (where the imprecision increases slowly), the technical improvement will permit us to <span class="epub-i">double</span> the length of time during which we can predict the state of the system with the desired precision. But for the second type of system (where the imprecision increases quickly), it will allow us to increase our “window of predictability” by only a fixed amount: for example, by one additional hour or one additional week (how much depends on the circumstances). Simplifying somewhat, we shall call systems of the first kind <span class="epub-i">non-chaotic</span> and systems of the second kind <span class="epub-i">chaotic</span> (or “sensitive to initial conditions”). Chaotic systems are therefore characterized by the fact that their predictability is sharply limited, because even a spectacular improvement in the precision of the initial data (for example, by a factor of 1000) leads only to a rather mediocre increase in the duration over which the predictions remain valid.<a href="note.html#chapter7-175" id="cha-175"><span class="epub-sup">175</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">It is perhaps not surprising that a very complex system, such as the Earth’s atmosphere, is difficult to predict. What is more surprising is that a system describable by a <span class="epub-i">small</span> number of variables and obeying simple deterministic equations—for example, a pair of pendulums attached together—may nevertheless exhibit very complex behavior and an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions.</p>
<p class="tx">However, one should avoid jumping to hasty philosophical conclusions.<a href="note.html#chapter7-176" id="cha-176"><span class="epub-sup">176</span></a> For example, it is frequently asserted that chaos theory has shown the limits of science. But many systems in Nature are non-chaotic; and even when studying chaotic systems, scientists do not find themselves at a dead end, or at a barrier which says “forbidden to go further”. Chaos theory opens up a vast area for future research and draws attention to many new objects of study.<a href="note.html#chapter7-177" id="cha-177"><span class="epub-sup">177</span></a> Besides, thoughtful scientists have always known that they cannot hope to predict or compute <span class="epub-i">everything.</span> It is perhaps unpleasant to learn that a specific object of interest (such as the weather three weeks hence) escapes our ability to predict it, but this does not halt the development of science. For example, physicists in the nineteenth century knew perfectly well that it is impossible in practice to know the positions of all the molecules of a gas. This spurred them to develop the methods of statistical physics, which have led to an understanding of many properties of systems (such as gases) that are composed of a large number of molecules. Similar statistical methods are employed nowadays to study chaotic phenomena. And, most importantly, the aim of science is not only to predict, but also to understand.</p>
<p class="tx">A second confusion concerns Laplace and determinism. Let us emphasize that in this long-standing debate it has always been essential to distinguish between determinism and predictability. Determinism depends on what Nature does (independently of us), while predictability depends in part on Nature and in part on us. To see this, let us imagine a perfectly predictable phenomenon—a clock, for example—which is, however, situated in an inaccessible place (say, the top of a mountain). The motion of the clock is unpredictable, <span class="epub-i">for us,</span> because we have no way of knowing its initial state. But it would be ridiculous to say that the clock’s motion ceases to be deterministic. Or to take another example, consider a pendulum: When there is no external force, its motion is deterministic and non-chaotic. When one applies a periodic force, its motion may become chaotic and thus much more difficult to predict; but does it cease to be deterministic?</p>
<p class="tx">Laplace’s work is often misunderstood. When he introduced the concept of universal determinism<a href="note.html#chapter7-178" id="cha-178"><span class="epub-sup">178</span></a>, he immediately added that <span class="epub-i">we</span> shall “always remain infinitely removed” from this imaginary “intelligence” and its ideal knowledge of the “respective situation of the beings who compose” the natural world, that is, in modern language, of the precise initial conditions of all the particles. He distinguished clearly between what Nature does and the knowledge we have of it. Moreover, he stated this principle at the beginning of an essay on <span class="epub-i">probability theory.</span> But, what is probability theory for Laplace? Nothing but a method that allows us to reason in situations of partial ignorance. The meaning of Laplace’s text is completely misrepresented if one imagines that <span class="epub-i">he</span> hoped to arrive someday at a perfect knowledge and a universal predictability, for the aim of his essay was precisely to explain how to proceed in the absence of such a perfect knowledge—as one does, for example, in statistical physics.</p>
<p class="txs">Over the past three decades, remarkable progress has been made in the mathematical theory of chaos, but the idea that some physical systems may exhibit a sensitivity to initial conditions is not new. Here is what James Clerk Maxwell said in 1877, after stating the principle of determinism (“the same causes will always produce the same effects”):</p>
<p class="exi">There is another maxim which must not be confounded with [this one], which asserts “That like causes produce like effects.”</p>
<p class="exi">This is only true when small variations in the initial circumstances produce only small variations in the final state of the system. In a great many physical phenomena this condition is satisfied; but there are other cases in which a small initial variation may produce a very great change in the final state of the system, as when the displacement of the “points” causes a railway train to run into another instead of keeping its proper course. (Maxwell 1952 [1877], pp. 13–14)<a href="note.html#chapter7-179" id="cha-179"><span class="epub-sup">179</span></a></p>
<p class="stnis">And, with regard to meteorological predictions, Henri Poincaré in 1909 was remarkably modern:</p>
<p class="ex">Why have meteorologists such difficulty in predicting the weather with any certainty? Why is it that showers and even storms seem to come by chance, so that many people think it quite natural to pray for rain or fine weather, though they would consider it ridiculous to ask for an eclipse by prayer? We see that great disturbances are generally produced in regions where the atmosphere is in unstable equilibrium. The meteorologists see very well that the equilibrium is unstable, that a cyclone will be formed somewhere, but exactly where they are not in a position to say; a tenth of a degree more or less at any given point, and the cyclone will burst here and not there, and extend its ravages over districts it would otherwise have spared. If they had been aware of this tenth of a degree, they could have known it beforehand, but the observations were neither sufficiently comprehensive nor sufficiently precise, and that is the reason why it all seems due to the intervention of chance. (Poincaré 1914 [1909], pp. 68–69)</p>
<p class="stx"><a id="pg143"/>Let us turn now to the confusions arising from misuse of the words “linear” and “nonlinear”. Let us first point out that, in mathematics, the word “linear” has two distinct meanings, which it is important not to confuse. On the one hand, one may speak of a <span class="epub-i">linear function</span> (or <span class="epub-i">equation</span>): for example, the functions <span class="epub-i">f(x)</span> = 2<span class="epub-i">x</span> and <span class="epub-i">f(x)</span> = −17<span class="epub-i">x</span> are linear, while the functions <span class="epub-i">f(x)</span> = <span class="epub-i">x</span><span class="epub-sup">2</span> and <span class="epub-i">f(x)</span>  = sin <span class="epub-i">x</span> are nonlinear. In terms of mathematical modelling, a linear equation describes a situation in which (simplifying somewhat) “the effect is proportional to the cause”.<a href="note.html#chapter7-180" id="cha-180"><span class="epub-sup">180</span></a> On the other hand, one may speak of a <span class="epub-i">linear order</span><a href="note.html#chapter7-181" id="cha-181"><span class="epub-sup">181</span></a>: this means that the elements of a set are ordered in such a way that, for each pair of elements <span class="epub-i">a</span> and <span class="epub-i">b,</span> one has either <span class="epub-i">a &lt; b, a = b,</span> or <span class="epub-i">a &gt; b.</span> For instance, there exists a natural linear order on the set of real numbers, while there is no natural such order on the complex numbers.<a href="note.html#chapter7-182" id="cha-182"><span class="epub-sup">182</span></a> Now, postmodernist authors (principally in the English-speaking world) have added a third meaning to the word—vaguely related to the second, but often confused by them with the first—in speaking of <span class="epub-i">linear thought.</span> No exact definition is given, but the general meaning is clear enough: it is the logical and rationalist thought of the Enlightenment and of so-called “classical” science (often accused of an extreme reductionism and numericism). In opposition to this old-fashioned way of thinking, they advocate a postmodern “nonlinear thought”. The precise content of the latter is not clearly explained either, but it is, apparently, a methodology that goes beyond reason by insisting on intuition and subjective perception.<a href="note.html#chapter7-183" id="cha-183"><span class="epub-sup">183</span></a> And it is frequently claimed that so-called postmodern science—and particularly chaos theory—justifies and supports this new “nonlinear thought”. But this assertion rests simply on a confusion between the three meanings of the word “linear”.<a href="note.html#chapter7-184" id="cha-184"><span class="epub-sup">184</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Because of these abuses, one often finds postmodernist authors who see chaos theory as a revolution against Newtonian mechanics—the latter being labelled “linear”—or who cite quantum mechanics as an example of a nonlinear theory.<a href="note.html#chapter7-185" id="cha-185"><span class="epub-sup">185</span></a> In actual fact, Newton’s “linear thought” uses equations that are perfectly <span class="epub-i">nonlinear;</span> this is why many examples in chaos theory come from Newtonian mechanics, so that the study of chaos represents in fact a <span class="epub-i">renaissance</span> of Newtonian mechanics as a subject for cutting-edge research. Likewise, quantum mechanics is often cited as the quintessential example of a “postmodern science”, but the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics—Schrödinger’s equation—is absolutely <span class="epub-i">linear.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Furthermore, the relationship between linearity, chaos, and an equation’s explicit solvability is often misunderstood. Nonlinear equations are generally more difficult to solve than linear equations, but not always: there exist very difficult linear problems and very simple nonlinear ones. For example, Newton’s equations for the two-body Kepler problem (the Sun and <span class="epub-i">one</span> planet) are nonlinear and yet explicitly solvable. Besides, for chaos to occur, it is necessary that the equation be nonlinear and (here we simplify somewhat) not explicitly solvable, but these two conditions are by no means <span class="epub-i">sufficient</span>—whether they occur separately or together—to produce chaos. Contrary to what people often think, a nonlinear system is not necessarily chaotic.</p>
<p class="tx">The difficulties and confusions multiply when one attempts to apply the mathematical theory of chaos to concrete situations in physics, biology, or the social sciences.<a href="note.html#chapter7-186" id="cha-186"><span class="epub-sup">186</span></a> To do this in a sensible way, one must first have some idea of the relevant variables and of the type of evolution they obey. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to find a mathematical model that is sufficiently simple to be analyzable and yet adequately describes the objects being considered. These problems arise, in fact, whenever one tries to apply a mathematical theory to reality.</p>
<p class="tx">Some purported “applications” of chaos theory—for example, to business management or literary analysis—border on the absurd.<a href="note.html#chapter7-187" id="cha-187"><span class="epub-sup">187</span></a> And, to make things worse, chaos theory—which is well-developed mathematically—is often confused with the still-emerging theories of complexity and self-organization.</p>
<p class="tx">Another major confusion is caused by mixing the mathematical theory of chaos with the popular wisdom that small causes can have large effects: “if Cleopatra’s nose had been shorter”, or the story of the missing nail that led to the collapse of an empire. One constantly hears claims of chaos theory being “applied” to history or society. But human societies are complicated systems involving a vast number of variables, for which one is unable (at least at present) to write down any sensible equations. To speak of chaos for these systems does not take us much further than the intuition already contained in the popular wisdom.<a href="note.html#chapter7-188" id="cha-188"><span class="epub-sup">188</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Yet another abuse arises from confusing (intentionally or not) the numerous distinct meanings of the highly evocative word “chaos”: its technical meaning in the mathematical theory of nonlinear dynamics—where it is roughly (though not exactly) synonymous with “sensitive dependence on initial conditions”—and its wider senses in sociology, politics, history and theology, where it is frequently taken as a synonym for disorder. As we shall see, Baudrillard and Deleuze–Guattari are especially shameless in exploiting (or falling into) these verbal confusions.</p>
