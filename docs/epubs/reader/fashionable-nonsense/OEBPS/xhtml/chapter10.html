<p class="ep">Architect and urban planner, former director of the École Spéciale d’Architecture, Paul Virilio poses questions about speed and space starting from the experience of war. For him, the mastery of time refers to power. With an astonishing erudition, which mixes space-distances and time-distances, this researcher opens up an important field of philosophical questions that he calls “dromocracy” (from the Greek <span class="epub-i">dromos:</span> speed).<a href="note.html#chapter10-219" id="cha-219"><span class="epub-sup">219</span></a></p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Le Monde (1984b, p. 195)</span></p>
<p class="linespace"> </p>
<p class="co">The writings of Paul Virilio revolve principally around the themes of technology, communication, and speed. They contain a plethora of references to physics, particularly the theory of relativity. Though Virilio’s sentences are slightly more meaningful than those of Deleuze–Guattari, what is presented as “science” is a mixture of monumental confusions and wild fantasies. Furthermore, his analogies between physics and social questions are the most arbitrary imaginable, when he does not simply become intoxicated with his own words. We confess our sympathy with many of Virilio’s political and social views; but the cause is not, alas, helped by his pseudo-physics.</p>
<p class="txs">Let us start with a minor example of the astonishing erudition vaunted by <span class="epub-i">Le Monde:</span></p>
<p class="exi">Recent <span class="epub-sc">MEGALOPOLITAN</span> hyperconcentration (Mexico City, Tokyo …) being itself the result of the increased speed of economic exchanges, it seems necessary to reconsider the importance of the notions of <span class="epub-sc">ACCELERATION</span> and <span class="epub-sc">DECELERATION</span> (what physicists call positive and negative velocities [<span class="epub-i">vitesses positive et négative selon les physiciens</span>])… (Virilio 1995, p. 24, capitals in the original<a href="note.html#chapter10-220" id="cha-220"><span class="epub-sup">220</span></a>)</p>
<p class="stni">Here Virilio mixes up velocity (<span class="epub-i">vitesse</span>) and acceleration, the two basic concepts of kinematics (the description of motion), which are introduced and carefully distinguished at the beginning of every introductory physics course.<a href="note.html#chapter10-221" id="cha-221"><span class="epub-sup">221</span></a> Perhaps this confusion isn’t worth stressing; but for a purported specialist in the philosophy of speed, it is nonetheless a bit surprising.</p>
<p class="txs">Drawing inspiration from the theory of relativity, Virilio continues:</p>
<p class="exi">How can we fully take in such a situation without enlisting the aid of a new type of interval, <span class="epub-sc">THE INTERVAL OF THE LIGHT KIND</span> (neutral sign)? The relativistic innovation of this third interval is actually in itself a sort of unremarked cultural revelation.</p>
<p class="exi">If the interval of <span class="epub-sc">TIME</span> (positive sign) and the interval of <span class="epub-sc">SPACE</span> (negative sign) have laid out the geography and history of the world through the geometric design of agrarian areas (fragmentation into plots of land) and urban areas (the cadastral system), the organization of calendars and the measurement of time (clocks) have also presided over a vast chronopolitical regulation of human societies. The very recent emergence of an interval of the third type thus signals a sudden qualitative leap, a profound mutation in the relationship between man and his surroundings.</p>
<p class="exi">T<span class="epub-sc">IME</span> (duration) and <span class="epub-sc">SPACE</span> (extension) are now inconceivable without <span class="epub-sc">LIGHT</span> (limit-speed), the cosmological constant of the <span class="epub-sc">SPEED OF LIGHT</span> … (Virilio 1995, p. 25; Virilio 1997, pp. 12–13; capitals in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">It is true that, in the special theory of relativity, one introduces “space-like”, “time-like”, and “light-like” intervals whose “invariant lengths” are respectively positive, negative, and zero (according to the usual convention). However, these are intervals in <span class="epub-i">space-time,</span> which do not coincide with what we habitually call “space” and “time”.<a href="note.html#chapter10-222" id="cha-222"><span class="epub-sup">222</span></a> Above all, they have nothing to do with the “geography and history of the world” or the “chronopolitical regulation of human societies”. The “very recent emergence of an interval of the third type” is nothing but a pedantic allusion to modern telecommunications. In this passage, Virilio shows perfectly how to package a banal observation in sophisticated terminology.</p>
<p class="txs">What comes next is even more surprising:</p>
<p class="exi">Listen to the physicist speaking about the logic of particles: “A representation is defined by a complete set of commuting observables.” [G. Cohen Tannoudji and M. Spiro, <span class="epub-i">La matière-espace-temps,</span> Paris, Fayard, 1986.] There is no better description of the macroscopic logic of the <span class="epub-sc">REAL-TIME</span> technologies of this sudden “teletopical commutation” that completes and perfects what until now had been the fundamentally “topical” nature of the City of Man. (Virilio 1995, p. 26, capitals in the original<a href="note.html#chapter10-223" id="cha-223"><span class="epub-sup">223</span></a>)</p>
<p class="stni">The sentence “A representation is defined by a complete set of commuting observables” is a rather common technical expression in <span class="epub-i">quantum mechanics</span> (not in relativity). It has nothing to do with “real time” or with any “macroscopic logic” (quite the contrary, it refers to <span class="epub-i">micro</span>physics), much less with “teletopical commutation” or the “City of Man”. But above all, in order to understand the precise meaning of this sentence, one needs to have studied physics and mathematics seriously for several years. We find it incredible that Virilio could <span class="epub-i">consciously</span> copy a sentence that he manifestly does not understand, add to it a completely arbitrary comment, and still be taken seriously by editors, commentators, and readers.<a href="note.html#chapter10-224" id="cha-224"><span class="epub-sup">224</span></a><span class="epub-sup">,</span><a href="note.html#chapter10-225" id="cha-225"><span class="epub-sup">225</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">Virilio’s works are overflowing with this pseudo-scientific verbiage.<a href="note.html#chapter10-226" id="cha-226"><span class="epub-sup">226</span></a> Here is another example:</p>
<p class="ex">What happens to the transparence of air, of water, of glass—one could say, of the “real space” of things surrounding us—when the <span class="epub-i">interface</span> of “real time” takes over from the classic “interval,” and when <span class="epub-i">distance</span> suddenly gives way to the <span class="epub-i">power</span> of transmission and instantaneous reception?… Transparence is no longer composed of light rays (solar or electric) but instead of elemental particles (electrons and photons) that are transmitted at the speed of light. (Virilio 1989, p. 129; Virilio 1990, p. 107; italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">For what it’s worth, electrons, unlike photons, have a non-zero mass and thus <span class="epub-i">cannot</span> move at the speed of light, precisely because of the theory of relativity of which Virilio seems so fond.</p>
<p class="txs">In what follows, Virilio continues to throw around scientific terminology, supplemented by his own inventions <span class="epub-i">(teletopology, chronoscopy):</span></p>
<p class="exi">This displacement of the direct transparence of a material is due primarily … to the effective use of <span class="epub-i">undulatory optics</span> alongside classic <span class="epub-i">geometric optics.</span> In the same way that alongside Euclidean geometry we find a non-Euclidean, topological geometry, the passive optics of the geometry of camera lenses and telescopes is accompanied by the active optics of the <span class="epub-i">teletopology</span> of optoelectric waves.</p>
<p class="exi">… Traditional chronology—future, present, past—has been succeeded by <span class="epub-sc">CHRONOSCOPY</span>—underexposed, exposed, overexposed. The interval of the <span class="epub-sc">TIME</span> genre (the positive sign) and the interval of the <span class="epub-sc">SPACE</span> genre (the negative sign, with the same name as the inscription surface of film) are inscribed only by <span class="epub-sc">LIGHT</span>, that interval of the third genre in which the <span class="epub-i">zero</span> sign means absolute speed.</p>
<p class="exi">The exposure time of the photographic plate is therefore merely time’s (space-time’s) exposure of its photosensitive material to the light of speed, which is to say, finally, to the frequency of photon-carrying waves. (Virilio 1989, p. 129; Virilio 1990, pp. 108–109, 115; italics and capitals in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">This mélange of optics, geometry, relativity, and photography needs no comment.</p>
<p class="txs">Let us round off our reading of Virilio’s writings on speed with this little marvel:</p>
<p class="ex">Remember that the dromospheric space, space-speed, is physically described by what is called the “logistic equation,” the result of the product of the mass displaced by the speed of its displacement, MxV. (Virilio 1984, p. 176; Virilio 1991, p. 136<a href="note.html#chapter10-227" id="cha-227"><span class="epub-sup">227</span></a>)</p>
<p class="stni">The logistic equation is a differential equation studied in population biology (among other fields); it is written <span class="epub-i">dx/dt = λx</span>(1–<span class="epub-i">x</span>) and was introduced by the mathematician Verhulst (1838). It has nothing to do with <span class="epub-i">M</span> × <span class="epub-i">V.</span> In Newtonian mechanics, <span class="epub-i">M</span> × <span class="epub-i">V</span> is called “momentum”; in relativistic mechanics, <span class="epub-i">M</span> × <span class="epub-i">V</span> does not arise at all. The <span class="epub-i">dromospheric space</span> is a Virilian invention.</p>
<p class="txs">Of course, no work in this genre would be complete without an allusion to Gödel’s theorem:</p>
<p class="exi">This drifting of figures and geometric figuring, this irruption of dimensions and transcendental mathematics, leads us to the promised surrealist peaks of scientific theory, peaks that culminate in Gödel’s theorem: the existential proof, a method that mathematically proves the existence of an object without producing that object … (Virilio 1991, p. 66)</p>
<p class="stni">In reality, existential proofs are much older than Gödel’s work; and the proof of his theorem is, by contrast, completely constructive: it exhibits a proposition that is neither provable nor refutable in the system under consideration (provided the system is consistent).<a href="note.html#chapter10-228" id="cha-228"><span class="epub-sup">228</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">And, to top it all off:</p>
<p class="exi">When depth of time replaces depths of sensible space; when the commutation of interface supplants the delimitation of surfaces; when transparence re-establishes appearances; then we begin to wonder whether that which we insist on calling <span class="epub-i">space</span> isn’t actually <span class="epub-i">light,</span> a subliminary, para-optical light of which sunlight is only one phase or reflection. This light occurs in a duration measured in instantaneous time exposure rather than the historical and chronological passage of time. The time of this instant without duration is “exposure time”, be it over- or underexposure. Its photographic and cinematographic technologies already predicted the existence and the time of a continuum stripped of all physical dimensions, in which the quantum of energetic action and the punctum of cinematic observation have suddenly become the last vestiges of a vanished morphological reality. Transferred into the eternal present of a relativity whose topological and teleological thickness and depth belong to this final measuring instrument, this speed of light possesses one direction, which is both its size and dimension and which propagates itself at the same speed in all radial directions that measure the universe. (Virilio 1984, p. 77; Virilio 1991, pp. 63–64; italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">This paragraph—which in the French original is a single 193-word sentence, whose “poetry” is unfortunately not fully captured by the translation—is the most perfect example of diarrhea of the pen that we have ever encountered. And as far as we can see, it means precisely nothing.</p>
