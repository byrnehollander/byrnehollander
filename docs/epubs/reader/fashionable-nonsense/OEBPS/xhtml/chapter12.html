<p class="ct" id="ch12"><span class="epub-b">12. Epilogue</span></p>
<p class="co">In this last chapter, we shall address some general questions—historical, sociological, and political—that arise naturally from a reading of the texts quoted in this book. We shall limit ourselves to explaining our point of view, without justifying it in detail. It goes without saying that we claim no special competence in history, sociology, or politics; and what we have to say must, in any case, be understood as conjectures rather than as the final word. If we do not simply remain silent on these questions, it is principally to avoid having ideas attributed to us against our will (as has already been done) and to show that our position on many issues is quite moderate.</p>
<p class="tx">Over the past two decades, much ink has been spilled about postmodernism, an intellectual current that is supposed to have replaced modern rationalist thought.<a href="note.html#chapter12-237" id="cha-237"><span class="epub-sup">237</span></a> However, the term “postmodernism” covers an ill-defined galaxy of ideas—ranging from art and architecture to the social sciences and philosophy—and we have no wish to discuss most of these areas.<a href="note.html#chapter12-238" id="cha-238"><span class="epub-sup">238</span></a> Our focus is limited to certain intellectual aspects of postmodernism that have had an impact on the humanities and the social sciences: a fascination with obscure discourses; an epistemic relativism linked to a generalized skepticism toward modern science; an excessive interest in subjective beliefs independently of their truth or falsity; and an emphasis on discourse and language as opposed to the facts to which those discourses refer (or, worse, the rejection of the very idea that facts exist or that one may refer to them).</p>
<p class="tx">Let us start by recognizing that many “postmodern” ideas, expressed in a moderate form, provide a needed correction to naive modernism (belief in indefinite and continuous progress, scientism, cultural Eurocentrism, etc.). What we are criticizing is the radical version of postmodernism, as well as a number of mental confusions that are found in the more moderate versions of postmodernism and that are in some sense inherited from the radical one.<a href="note.html#chapter12-239" id="cha-239"><span class="epub-sup">239</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">We shall begin by considering the tensions that have always existed between the “two cultures” but that seem to have worsened during the last few years, as well as the conditions for a fruitful dialogue between the humanities and social sciences and the natural sciences. We shall then analyze some of the intellectual and political sources of postmodernism. Finally, we shall discuss the negative aspects of postmodernism for both culture and politics.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">For a Real Dialogue Between the “Two Cultures”</span></p>
<p class="tni">Interdisciplinarity seems to be the order of the day. Though some people worry that the dilution of specialization may lead to a decline in the standards of intellectual rigor, the insights that one field of thought can bring to another cannot be ignored. By no means do we wish to inhibit interaction between the mathematico-physical sciences and the human sciences; rather, our aim is to emphasize some preconditions we see as necessary for a real dialogue.</p>
<p class="tx">Over the past few years, it has become fashionable to talk about a so-called “science war”.<a href="note.html#chapter12-240" id="cha-240"><span class="epub-sup">240</span></a> But this phrase is quite unfortunate. Who is waging war, and against whom?</p>
<p class="tx">Science and technology have long been the subject of philosophical and political debates: on nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, the human genome project, sociobiology, and many other subjects. But these debates in no way constitute a “science war”. Indeed, many different reasonable positions in these debates are advocated by scientists and non-scientists alike, using scientific and ethical arguments that can be rationally evaluated by all the people involved, whatever their profession.</p>
<p class="tx">Unfortunately, some recent developments may lead one to fear that something completely different is going on. For example, researchers in the social sciences can legitimately feel threatened by the idea that neurophysiology and sociobiology will replace their disciplines. Similarly, people working in the natural sciences may feel under attack when Feyerabend calls science a “particular superstition”<a href="note.html#chapter12-241" id="cha-241"><span class="epub-sup">241</span></a> or when some currents in the sociology of science give the impression of placing astronomy and astrology on the same footing.<a href="note.html#chapter12-242" id="cha-242"><span class="epub-sup">242</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">In order to alleviate these fears, it is worth distinguishing between the claims made for research programmes, which tend to be grandiose, and the actual accomplishments, which are generally rather modest. The basic principles of chemistry are today entirely based on quantum mechanics, hence on physics; and yet, chemistry as an autonomous discipline has not disappeared (even if some parts of it have gotten closer to physics). Likewise, if one day the biological bases of our behavior were sufficiently well understood to serve as a foundation for the study of human beings, there would be no reason to fear that the disciplines we now call “social sciences” would somehow disappear or become mere branches of biology.<a href="note.html#chapter12-243" id="cha-243"><span class="epub-sup">243</span></a> In a similar way, scientists have nothing to fear from a realistic historical and sociological view of the scientific enterprise, provided that a certain number of epistemological confusions are avoided.<a href="note.html#chapter12-244" id="cha-244"><span class="epub-sup">244</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Let us therefore put aside the “science war”, and see what kind of lessons can be drawn from the texts cited in this book concerning the relationship between the natural and the human sciences.<a href="note.html#chapter12-245" id="cha-245"><span class="epub-sup">245</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">1. <span class="epub-i">It’s a good idea to know what one is talking about.</span> Anyone who insists on speaking about the natural sciences—and nobody is forced to do so—needs to be well-informed and to avoid making arbitrary statements about the sciences or their epistemology. This may seem obvious, but as the texts gathered in this book demonstrate, it is all too often ignored, even (or especially) by renowned intellectuals.</p>
<p class="tx">Obviously, it is legitimate to think philosophically about the content of the natural sciences. Many concepts used by scientists—such as the notions of law, explanation, and causality—contain hidden ambiguities, and philosophical reflection can help to clarify the ideas. But, in order to address these subjects meaningfully, one has to understand the relevant scientific theories at a rather deep and inevitably technical level<a href="note.html#chapter12-246" id="cha-246"><span class="epub-sup">246</span></a>; a vague understanding, at the level of popularizations, won’t suffice.</p>
<p class="tx">2. <span class="epub-i">Not all that is obscure is necessarily profound.</span> There is a huge difference between discourses that are difficult because of the inherent nature of their subject and those whose vacuity or banality is carefully hidden behind deliberately obscure prose. (This problem is by no means specific to the humanities or social sciences; many articles in physics and mathematics use a language more complicated than is strictly necessary.) Of course, it is not always easy to determine which kind of difficulty one is facing; and those who are accused of using obscure jargon frequently reply that the natural sciences also use a technical language that can be mastered only after many years of study. Nevertheless, it seems to us that there are some criteria that can be used to help distinguish between the two sorts of difficulty. First, when the difficulty is genuine, it is usually possible to explain in simple terms, at some rudimentary level, what phenomena the theory is examining, what are its main results, and what are the strongest arguments in its favor.<a href="note.html#chapter12-247" id="cha-247"><span class="epub-sup">247</span></a> For example, although neither of us has any training in biology, we are able to follow, at some basic level, developments in that field by reading good popular or semi-popular books. Second, in these cases there is a clear path—possibly a long one—that will lead to a deeper knowledge of the subject. By contrast, some obscure discourses give the impression that the reader is being asked to make a qualitative jump, or to undergo an experience similar to a revelation, in order to understand them.<a href="note.html#chapter12-248" id="cha-248"><span class="epub-sup">248</span></a> Again, one cannot help being reminded of the emperor’s new clothes.<a href="note.html#chapter12-249" id="cha-249"><span class="epub-sup">249</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">3. <span class="epub-i">Science is not a “text”.</span> The natural sciences are not a mere reservoir of metaphors ready to be used in the human sciences. Non-scientists may be tempted to isolate from a scientific theory some general “themes” that can be summarized in few words such as “uncertainty”, “discontinuity”, “chaos”, or “non-linearity” and then analyzed in a purely verbal manner. But scientific theories are not like novels; in a scientific context these words have specific meanings, which differ in subtle but crucial ways from their everyday meanings, and which can only be understood within a complex web of theory and experiment. If one uses them only as metaphors, one is easily led to nonsensical conclusions.<a href="note.html#chapter12-250" id="cha-250"><span class="epub-sup">250</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">4. <span class="epub-i">Don’t ape the natural sciences.</span> The social sciences have their own problems and their own methods; they are not obliged to follow each “paradigm shift” (be it real or imaginary) in physics or biology. For example, although the laws of physics at the atomic level are expressed today in a probabilistic language, deterministic theories can nevertheless be valid (to a very good approximation) at other levels, for example in fluid mechanics or even possibly (and yet more approximately) for certain social or economic phenomena. Conversely, even if the fundamental physical laws were perfectly deterministic, our ignorance would force us to introduce a great number of probabilistic models in order to study phenomena at other levels, like gases or societies. Besides, even if one adopts a reductionist <span class="epub-i">philosophical</span> attitude, one is by no means obliged to pursue reductionism as a <span class="epub-i">methodological</span> prescription.<a href="note.html#chapter12-251" id="cha-251"><span class="epub-sup">251</span></a> In practice, there are so many orders of magnitude separating atoms from fluids, brains, or societies that vastly different models and methods are quite naturally employed in each realm, and establishing a link between these levels of analysis is not necessarily the most urgent task. In other words, the type of approach in each domain of research should depend upon the specific phenomena under investigation. Psychologists, for example, do not need to invoke quantum mechanics to maintain that <span class="epub-i">in their field</span> “the observer affects the observed”; this is a truism, irrespective of the behavior of electrons or atoms.</p>
<p class="tx">Moreover, there are so many phenomena, even in physics, that are imperfectly understood, at least for the time being, that there is no reason to try to imitate the natural sciences when dealing with complex human problems. It is perfectly legitimate to turn to intuition or literature in order to obtain some kind of nonscientific understanding of those aspects of human experience that cannot, at least at present, be tackled more rigorously.</p>
<p class="tx">5. <span class="epub-i">Be wary of argument from authority.</span> If the human sciences want to benefit from the undeniable successes of the natural sciences, they need not do so by directly extrapolating technical scientific concepts. Instead, they could get some inspiration from the best of the natural sciences’ <span class="epub-i">methodological</span> principles, starting with this one: to evaluate the validity of a proposition on the basis of the facts and reasoning supporting it, without regard to the personal qualities or social status of its advocates or detractors.</p>
<p class="tx">This is, of course, only a <span class="epub-i">principle;</span> it is far from universally honored in practice, even in the natural sciences. Scientists are, after all, human beings and are not immune to fashion or to the adulation of geniuses. Nevertheless, we have inherited from the “epistemology of the Enlightenment” a totally justified mistrust toward the exegesis of sacred texts (and texts that are not religious in the traditional sense may very well fulfill that role) as well as toward argument from authority.</p>
<p class="tx">We met in Paris a student who, after having brilliantly finished his undergraduate studies in physics, began reading philosophy and in particular Deleuze. He was trying to tackle <span class="epub-i">Difference and Repetition.</span> Having read the mathematical excerpts examined here (see <a href="chapter9.html#pg161">here</a>), he admitted he couldn’t see what Deleuze was driving at. Nevertheless, Deleuze’s reputation for profundity was so strong that he hesitated to draw the natural conclusion: that if someone like himself, who had studied calculus for several years, was unable to understand these texts, allegedly about calculus, it was probably because they didn’t make much sense. It seems to us that this example should have encouraged the student to analyze more critically the rest of Deleuze’s writings.</p>
<p class="tx">6. <span class="epub-i">Specific skepticism should not be confused with radical skepticism.</span> It is important to distinguish carefully between two different types of critiques of the sciences: those that are opposed to a particular theory and are based on specific arguments, and those that repeat in one form or another the traditional arguments of radical skepticism. The former critiques can be interesting but can also be refuted, while the latter are irrefutable but uninteresting (because of their universality). And it is crucial not to mix the two sorts of arguments: for if one wants to contribute to science, be it natural or social, one must abandon radical doubts concerning the viability of logic or the possibility of knowing the world through observation and/or experiment. Of course, one can always have doubts about a specific theory. But general skeptical arguments put forward to support those doubts are irrelevant, precisely because of their generality.</p>
<p class="tx">7. <span class="epub-i">Ambiguity as subterfuge.</span> We have seen in this book numerous ambiguous texts that can be interpreted in two different ways: as an assertion that is true but relatively banal, or as one that is radical but manifestly false. And we cannot help thinking that, in many cases, these ambiguities are deliberate. Indeed, they offer a great advantage in intellectual battles: the radical interpretation can serve to attract relatively inexperienced listeners or readers; and if the absurdity of this version is exposed, the author can always defend himself by claiming to have been misunderstood, and retreat to the innocuous interpretation.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">How Did We Get Here?</span></p>
<p class="tni">In the debates that followed the publication of the <span class="epub-i">Social Text</span> parody, we were often asked: How and why did the intellectual trends that you are criticizing develop? This is a very complicated question belonging to the history and sociology of ideas, to which we certainly do not claim to have a definitive answer. We would like, rather, to put forward some possible answers, while emphasizing both their conjectural nature and their incompleteness (there are undoubtedly other elements that we have underestimated or missed entirely). Moreover, as always in this kind of complex social phenomenon, there is a mixture of very diverse causes. In this section we shall limit ourselves to the intellectual sources of postmodernism and relativism, leaving the political aspects for the next section.</p>
<p class="tx">1. <span class="epub-i">Neglect of the empirical.</span> For a long time, it has been fashionable to denounce “empiricism”; and if that word denotes an allegedly fixed method for extracting theories from facts, we can only agree. Scientific activity has always involved a complex interplay between observation and theory, and scientists have known that for a long time.<a href="note.html#chapter12-252" id="cha-252"><span class="epub-sup">252</span></a> So-called “empiricist” science is a caricature belonging to bad schoolbooks.</p>
<p class="tx">Nevertheless, our theories about the physical or social world need to be justified in one way or another; and if one eschews apriorism, argument from authority, and reference to “sacred” texts, there is not much left besides the systematic test of theory by observations and experiments. One need not be a strict Popperian to realize that any theory must be supported, at least indirectly, by empirical evidence in order to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="tx">Some of the texts cited in this book completely disregard the empirical aspect of science and concentrate exclusively on language and theoretical formalism. They give the impression that a discourse becomes “scientific” as soon as it seems superficially coherent, even if it is never subjected to empirical tests. Or, worse, that it is sufficient to throw mathematical formulae at problems in order to make progress.</p>
<p class="tx">2. <span class="epub-i">Scientism in the social sciences.</span> This point may seem bizarre: Isn’t scientism the sin of physicists and biologists who seek to reduce everything to matter in motion, natural selection, and DNA? Yes and no. Let us define “scientism”, for the purposes of this discussion, as the illusion that simplistic but supposedly “objective” or “scientific” methods will allow us to solve very complex problems (other definitions are certainly possible). The difficulty that constantly arises when one succumbs to such illusions is that important parts of reality are forgotten simply because they fail to fit within the framework that was posed <span class="epub-i">a priori.</span> Sadly, examples of scientism are abundant in the social sciences: one can cite, among others, certain currents within quantitative sociology, neoclassical economics, behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and Marxism.<a href="note.html#chapter12-253" id="cha-253"><span class="epub-sup">253</span></a> Often what happens is that people start with a set of ideas having some validity in a given domain and, instead of trying to test them and refine them, they extrapolate them unreasonably.</p>
<p class="txs">Unfortunately, scientism has often been confused—by its supporters as well as by its detractors—with the scientific attitude itself. As a result, the entirely justified reaction against scientism in the social sciences has sometimes led to an equally unjustified reaction against science as such—and this on the part of both the ex-partisans and ex-opponents of the old scientisms. For example, in France after May 1968, the reaction against the scientism of certain rather dogmatic strains of structuralism and Marxism was one factor (among many others) that led to the emergence of postmodernism (the “incredulity toward metanarratives”, to quote Lyotard’s famous catchword<a href="note.html#chapter12-254" id="cha-254"><span class="epub-sup">254</span></a>). A similar evolution occurred, in the 1990s, among some intellectuals in the former Communist countries: for instance, the Czech president Václav Havel wrote that</p>
<p class="ex">The fall of Communism can be regarded as a sign that modern thought—based on the premise that the world is objectively knowable, and that the knowledge so obtained can be absolutely generalized—has come to a final crisis. (Havel 1992)</p>
<p class="stni">(One wonders why a renowned thinker such as Havel is incapable of making the elementary distinction between the scientific worldview and the Communist regimes’ unjustified <span class="epub-i">claim</span> to possess a “scientific” theory of human history.)</p>
<p class="tx">When one combines neglect of the empirical side with a good deal of scientistic dogmatism, one can be led into the worst lucubrations, of which we have seen all too many examples. But one can alternatively fall into a sort of discouragement: since such and such (simplistic) method, to which one had dogmatically adhered, does not work, therefore nothing works, all knowledge is impossible or subjective, etc. And so one passes easily from the climate of the 1960s and 1970s to postmodernism. But it is based on a misidentification of the source of the problem.</p>
<p class="tx">One recent avatar of scientism in the social sciences is, paradoxically, the “strong programme” in the sociology of science. To try to explain the content of scientific theories without taking into account, even in part, the rationality of scientific activity is to eliminate <span class="epub-i">a priori</span> an element of reality and, it seems to us, to deprive oneself of any possibility of effectively understanding the problem. To be sure, every scientific study must make simplifications and approximations; and the approach of the “strong programme” would be legitimate if its advocates were to provide empirical or logical arguments showing that the neglected aspects are indeed of marginal importance for understanding the phenomena in question. But no such arguments are given; the principle is posed <span class="epub-i">a priori.</span> In reality, the strong programme is trying to make a virtue of (apparent) necessity: since it is difficult for sociologists to study the internal rationality of the natural sciences, it is declared “scientific” to ignore it. It is like trying to complete a puzzle when one knows that half the pieces are missing.</p>
<p class="tx">We believe that the scientific attitude, understood very broadly—as a respect for the clarity and logical coherence of theories, and for the confrontation of theories with empirical evidence—is as relevant in the social sciences as it is in the natural sciences. But one must be very prudent toward claims of scientificity in the social sciences; this holds also (or even especially) for the currently dominant trends in economics, sociology, and psychology. The problems addressed by the social sciences are extremely complex, and the empirical evidence supporting their theories is often quite weak.</p>
<p class="tx">3. <span class="epub-i">The prestige of the natural sciences.</span> There is no doubt that the natural sciences enjoy an enormous prestige, even among their detractors, because of their theoretical and practical successes. Scientists sometimes abuse this prestige by displaying an unjustified feeling of superiority. Moreover, well-known scientists, in their popular writings, often put forward speculative ideas as if they were well-established, or extrapolate their results far beyond the domain where they have been verified. Finally, there is a damaging tendency—exacerbated, no doubt, by the demands of marketing—to see a “radical conceptual revolution” in each innovation. All these factors combined give the educated public a distorted view of scientific activity.</p>
<p class="tx">But it would be demeaning to philosophers, psychologists, and sociologists to suggest that they are defenseless in the face of such scientists, and that the abuses exposed in this book are somehow unavoidable. It is obvious that no one, and in particular no scientist, forced Deleuze or Lacan to write as they do. One can perfectly well be a psychologist or a philosopher and either speak about the natural sciences knowing what one is talking about, or else not speak about them and concentrate on other things.</p>
<p class="tx">4. <span class="epub-i">The social sciences’ “natural” relativism.</span> In certain branches of the social sciences, notably in anthropology, a certain “relativistic” attitude is methodologically natural, especially when one is studying tastes or customs: the anthropologist is seeking to understand these customs’ role in a given society, and it is difficult to see what she would gain by dragging into her research her own aesthetic preferences. Similarly, when studying certain cognitive aspects of a culture, such as the social role of the culture’s cosmological beliefs, the anthropologist is not principally concerned with knowing whether those beliefs are true or false.<a href="note.html#chapter12-255" id="cha-255"><span class="epub-sup">255</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">However, this reasonable methodological relativism has sometimes led, through confusions of thought and language, to a radical cognitive relativism: namely, the claim that assertions of fact—be they traditional myths or modern scientific theories—can be considered true or false only “relative to a particular culture”. But this amounts to confusing the psychological and social functions of a system of thought with its cognitive value, and to ignoring the strength of the empirical arguments that can be put forward in favor of one system of thought over another.</p>
<p class="tx">Here is a concrete example of such a confusion: There are at least two competing theories concerning the origin of Native American populations. The scientific consensus, based on extensive archaeological evidence, is that humans first came to the Americas from Asia around 10–20,000 years ago, crossing the Bering Strait. On the other hand, many Native American creation accounts hold that native peoples have always lived in the Americas, ever since their ancestors emerged onto the surface of the earth from a subterranean world of spirits. And a report in the <span class="epub-i">New York Times</span> (22 October 1996) observed that many archaeologists, “pulled between their scientific temperaments and their appreciation for native culture … have been driven close to a postmodern relativism in which science is just one more belief system.” For example, Roger Anyon, a British archaeologist who has worked for the Zuni people, was quoted as saying that “science is just one of many ways of knowing the world.… [The Zunis’ world view is] just as valid as the archeological viewpoint of what prehistory is about.”<a href="note.html#chapter12-256" id="cha-256"><span class="epub-sup">256</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Perhaps Dr. Anyon was misquoted<a href="note.html#chapter12-257" id="cha-257"><span class="epub-sup">257</span></a>, but one does hear this type of assertion rather frequently nowadays, and we would like to analyze it. Note first that the word “valid” is ambiguous: is it intended in a cognitive sense, or in some other sense? If the latter, we have no objection; but the reference to “knowing the world” suggests the former. Now, both in philosophy and in everyday language, there is a distinction between <span class="epub-i">knowledge</span> (understood, roughly, as justified true belief) and mere <span class="epub-i">belief;</span> that is why the word “knowledge” has a positive connotation, while “belief” is neutral. What, then, does Anyon mean by “knowing the world”? If he intends the word “knowing” in its traditional sense, then his assertion is simply false: the two theories in question are mutually incompatible, so they cannot both be true (or even approximately true).<a href="note.html#chapter12-258" id="cha-258"><span class="epub-sup">258</span></a> If, on the other hand, he is simply noting that different people have different beliefs, then his assertion is true (and banal), but it is misleading to employ the success-word “knowledge”.<a href="note.html#chapter12-259" id="cha-259"><span class="epub-sup">259</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Most likely, the archaeologist has quite simply allowed his political and cultural sympathies to cloud his reasoning. But there is no justification for such intellectual confusion: we can perfectly well remember the victims of a horrible genocide, and support their descendants’ valid political goals, without endorsing uncritically (or hypocritically) their societies’ traditional creation myths. (After all, if you want to support Native American land claims, does it <span class="epub-i">really</span> matter whether Native Americans have been in North America “forever” or <span class="epub-i">merely</span> for 10,000 years?) Moreover, the relativists’ stance is extremely condescending: it treats a complex society as a monolith, obscures the conflicts within it, and takes its most obscurantist factions as spokespeople for the whole.</p>
<p class="tx">5. <span class="epub-i">The traditional philosophical and literary training.</span> We have no desire to criticize this training as such; indeed, it is probably adequate for the goals it pursues. Nevertheless, it may be a handicap when one turns to scientific texts, for two reasons.</p>
<p class="tx">First of all, the author or the literality of the text have, in literature or even in philosophy, a relevance they do not have in science. One can learn physics without ever reading Galileo, Newton, or Einstein, and study biology without reading a line of Darwin.<a href="note.html#chapter12-260" id="cha-260"><span class="epub-sup">260</span></a> What matters are the factual and theoretical arguments these authors offer, not the words they used. Besides, their ideas may have been radically modified or even overturned by subsequent developments in their disciplines. Furthermore, scientists’ personal qualities and extra-scientific beliefs are irrelevant to the evaluation of their theories. Newton’s mysticism and alchemy, for example, are important for the history of science and more generally for the history of human thought, but not for physics.</p>
<p class="tx">The second problem comes from the privilege granted to theories over experiments (which is related to the privilege granted to texts over facts). The link between a scientific theory and its experimental test is often extremely complex and indirect. Therefore, a philosopher will tend to approach the sciences preferentially through their conceptual aspect (so do we, in fact). But the whole problem comes precisely from the fact that, if one does not <span class="epub-i">also</span> take into account the empirical aspects, then scientific discourse indeed becomes nothing more than a “myth” or “narration” among many others.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">The Role of Politics</span></p>
<p class="ep">It’s not we who lord it over things, it seems, but things which lord it over us. But that’s only because some people make use of things in order to lord it over others. We shall only be freed from the forces of nature when we are free of human force. Our knowledge of nature must be supplemented with a knowledge of human society if we are to use our knowledge of nature in a human way.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Bertolt Brecht (1965 [1939–1940], pp. 42–43)</span></p>
<p class="stx">The origins of postmodernism are not purely intellectual. Both philosophical relativism and the works of the authors analyzed here have had a specific appeal to some political tendencies that can be characterized (or characterize themselves) as left-wing or progressive. Moreover, the “science wars” are often viewed as a political conflict between “progressives” and “conservatives”.<a href="note.html#chapter12-261" id="cha-261"><span class="epub-sup">261</span></a> Of course, there is also a long antirationalist tradition in some right-wing movements, but what is new and curious about postmodernism is that it is an antirationalist form of thought that has seduced part of the left.<a href="note.html#chapter12-262" id="cha-262"><span class="epub-sup">262</span></a> We shall try here to analyze how this sociological link came to be, and to explain why it is due, in our opinion, to a number of conceptual confusions. We shall limit ourselves mainly to the situation in the United States, where the link between postmodernism and some tendencies on the political left is particularly clear.</p>
<p class="tx">When one discusses a set of ideas, such as postmodernism, from a political point of view, it is important to distinguish carefully between the intrinsic intellectual value of those ideas, the objective political role they play, and the subjective reasons for which various people defend or attack them. Now, it often happens that a given social group shares two ideas (or two groups of ideas), call them A and B. Let us suppose that A is relatively valid, that B is much less valid, and that there is no real logical link between the two. People belonging to the social group will often try to legitimize B by invoking the validity of A and the existence of a sociological link between A and B. Conversely, their opponents will try to denigrate A by citing the lack of validity of B and the same sociological link.<a href="note.html#chapter12-263" id="cha-263"><span class="epub-sup">263</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">The existence of such a link between postmodernism and the left constitutes, prima facie, a serious paradox. For most of the past two centuries, the left has been identified with science and against obscurantism, believing that rational thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social) are incisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful—not to mention being desirable human ends in their own right. And yet, over the past two decades, a large number of “progressive” or “leftist” academic humanists and social scientists (though virtually no natural scientists, whatever their political views) have turned away from this Enlightenment legacy and—bolstered by French imports such as deconstruction as well as by home-grown doctrines like feminist standpoint epistemology—have embraced one or another version of epistemic relativism. Our aim here is to understand the causes of this historical <span class="epub-i">volte-face.</span></p>
<p class="tx">We shall distinguish three types of intellectual sources linked to the emergence of postmodernism within the political left<a href="note.html#chapter12-264" id="cha-264"><span class="epub-sup">264</span></a>:</p>
<p class="tx">1. <span class="epub-i">The new social movements.</span> The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of new social movements—the black liberation movement, the feminist movement, and the gay-rights movement, among others—struggling against forms of oppression that had largely been underestimated by the traditional political left. More recently, some tendencies within these movements have concluded that postmodernism, in one form or another, is the philosophy most suited to their aspirations.</p>
<p class="tx">There are two separate issues to discuss. One is conceptual: is there a logical link, in either direction, between the new social movements and postmodernism? The other is sociological: to what extent have the members of these movements embraced postmodernism, and for what reasons?</p>
<p class="tx">One factor driving the new social movements toward postmodernism was, undoubtedly, a dissatisfaction with the old leftist orthodoxies. The traditional left, in both its Marxist and non-Marxist variants, generally saw itself as the rightful inheritor of the Enlightenment and as the embodiment of science and rationality. Moreover, Marxism explicitly linked philosophical materialism to a theory of history giving primacy—in some versions, near-exclusivity—to economic and class struggles. The evident narrowness of this latter perspective understandably led some currents within the new social movements to reject, or at least distrust, science and rationality as such.</p>
<p class="tx">But this is a conceptual error, which mirrors an identical error committed by the traditional Marxist left. In fact, concrete socio-political theories can never be deduced logically from abstract philosophical schemes; and conversely, there is no unique philosophical position compatible with a given socio-political program. In particular, as Bertrand Russell observed long ago, there is no logical connection between philosophical materialism and Marxian historical materialism. Philosophical materialism is compatible with the idea that history is determined primarily by religion, sexuality, or climate (which would run counter to historical materialism); and conversely, economic factors could be the primary determinants of human history even if mental events were sufficiently independent of physical events to make philosophical materialism false. Russell concludes: “It is of some moment to realize such facts as this, because otherwise political theories are both supported and opposed for quite irrelevant reasons, and arguments of theoretical philosophy are employed to determine questions which depend upon concrete facts of human nature. This mixture damages both philosophy and politics, and is therefore important to avoid.”<a href="note.html#chapter12-265" id="cha-265"><span class="epub-sup">265</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">The sociological link between postmodernism and the new social movements is an exceedingly complicated one. A satisfactory analysis would require, at the very least, disentangling the various strands that compose “postmodernism” (as the logical relations between them are quite weak), treating each of the new social movements individually (as their histories are quite different), sorting out the distinct currents within these movements, and distinguishing the roles played by activists and theorists. This is a problem requiring (dare we say it?) careful empirical investigation, and we leave it to sociologists and intellectual historians. Let us nevertheless state our <span class="epub-i">conjecture</span> that the new social movements’ penchant for postmodernism exists mostly within academia and is much weaker than both the postmodernist left and the traditionalist right generally portray it to be.<a href="note.html#chapter12-266" id="cha-266"><span class="epub-sup">266</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">2. <span class="epub-i">Political discouragement.</span> Another source of postmodern ideas is the desperate situation and general disorientation of the left, a situation that appears to be unique in its history. The communist regimes have collapsed; the social-democratic parties, where they remain in power, apply watered-down neo-liberal policies; and the Third World movements that led their countries to independence have, in most cases, abandoned any attempt at autonomous development. In short, the harshest form of “free market” capitalism seems to have become the implacable reality for the foreseeable future. Never before have the ideals of justice and equality seemed so utopian. Without entering into an analysis of the causes of this situation (much less proposing solutions), it is easy to understand that it generates a kind of discouragement that expresses itself in part in postmodernism. The linguist and activist Noam Chomsky has described this evolution very well<a href="note.html#chapter12-267" id="cha-267"><span class="epub-sup">267</span></a>:</p>
<p class="ex">If you really feel, Look, it’s too hard to deal with real problems, there are lots of ways to avoid doing so. One of them is to go off on wild goose chases that don’t matter. Another is to get involved in academic cults that are very divorced from any reality and that provide a defense against dealing with the world as it actually is. There’s plenty of that going on, including in the left. I just saw some very depressing examples of it in my trip to Egypt a couple of weeks ago. I was there to talk on international affairs. There’s a very lively, civilized intellectual community, very courageous people who spent years in Nasser’s jails being practically tortured to death and came out struggling. Now throughout the Third World there’s a sense of great despair and hopelessness. The way it showed up there, in very educated circles with European connections, was to become totally immersed in the latest lunacies of Paris culture and to focus totally on those. For example, when I would give talks about current realities, even in research institutes dealing with strategic issues, participants wanted it to be translated into post-modern gibberish. For example, rather than have me talk about the details of what’s going on in U.S. policy or the Middle East, where they live, which is too grubby and uninteresting, they would like to know how does modern linguistics provide a new paradigm for discourse about international affairs that will supplant the post-structuralist text. That would really fascinate them. But not what do Israeli cabinet records show about internal planning. That’s really depressing. (Chomsky 1994, pp. 163–164)</p>
<p class="stni">In this way, the remnants of the left have collaborated in driving the last nail in the coffin of the ideals of justice and progress. We modestly suggest letting in a little bit of air, in the hope that one day the corpse will awaken.</p>
<p class="tx">3. <span class="epub-i">Science as an easy target.</span> In this atmosphere of general discouragement, it is tempting to attack something that is sufficiently linked to the powers-that-be so as not to appear very sympathetic, but sufficiently weak to be a more-or-less accessible target (since the concentration of power and money are beyond reach). Science fulfills these conditions, and this partly explains the attacks against it. In order to analyze these attacks, it is crucial to distinguish at least four different senses of the word “science”: an intellectual endeavor aimed at a rational understanding of the world; a collection of accepted theoretical and experimental ideas; a social community with particular mores, institutions and links to the larger society; and, finally, applied science and technology (with which science is often confused). All too frequently, valid critiques of “science”, understood in one of these senses, are taken to be arguments against science in a different sense.<a href="note.html#chapter12-268" id="cha-268"><span class="epub-sup">268</span></a> Thus, it is undeniable that science, as a social institution, is linked to political, economic, and military power, and that the social role played by scientists is often pernicious. It is also true that technology has mixed results—sometimes disastrous ones—and that it rarely yields the miracle solutions that its most fervent advocates regularly promise.<a href="note.html#chapter12-269" id="cha-269"><span class="epub-sup">269</span></a> Finally, science, considered as a body of knowledge, is always fallible, and scientists’ errors are sometimes due to all sorts of social, political, philosophical, or religious prejudices. We are in favor of reasonable criticisms of science understood in all these senses. In particular, the critiques of science viewed as a body of knowledge—at least those that are most convincing—follow, in general, a standard pattern: First one shows, using conventional scientific arguments, why the research in question is flawed according to the ordinary canons of good science; then, and only then, one attempts to explain how the researchers’ social prejudices (which may well have been unconscious) led them to violate these canons. One may be tempted to jump directly to the second step, but the critique then loses much of its force.</p>
<p class="tx">Unfortunately, some critiques go beyond attacking the worst aspects of science (militarism, sexism, etc.) and attack its best aspects: the attempt at rationally understanding the world, and the scientific method, understood broadly as a respect for empirical evidence and for logic.<a href="note.html#chapter12-270" id="cha-270"><span class="epub-sup">270</span></a> It is naive to believe that it is not the rational attitude itself that is really challenged by postmodernism. Moreover, this aspect is an easy target, because any attack on rationality can find a host of allies: all those who believe in superstitions, be they traditional ones (e.g. religious fundamentalism) or New Age.<a href="note.html#chapter12-271" id="cha-271"><span class="epub-sup">271</span></a> If one adds to that a facile confusion between science and technology, one arrives at a struggle that is relatively popular, though not particularly progressive.</p>
<p class="txs">Those who wield political or economic power will quite naturally prefer that science and technology be attacked as such, because these attacks help conceal the relationships of force on which their own power is based. Furthermore, by attacking rationality, the postmodern left deprives itself of a powerful instrument for criticizing the existing social order. Chomsky observes that, in a not-so-distant past,</p>
<p class="ex">Left intellectuals took an active part in the lively working class culture. Some sought to compensate for the class character of the cultural institutions through programs of workers’ education, or by writing best-selling books on mathematics, science, and other topics for the general public. Remarkably, their left counterparts today often seek to deprive working people of these tools of emancipation, informing us that the “project of the Enlightenment” is dead, that we must abandon the “illusions” of science and rationality—a message that will gladden the hearts of the powerful, delighted to monopolize these instruments for their own use. (Chomsky 1993, p. 286)</p>
<p class="stx">Finally, let us briefly discuss the subjective motivations of those who are opposed to postmodernism. These are complicated to analyze, and the reactions that followed the publication of Sokal’s parody suggest a prudent reflection. Many people are simply irritated by the arrogance and empty verbiage of postmodernist discourse and by the spectacle of an intellectual community where everyone repeats sentences that no one understands. It goes without saying that we share, with some nuances, this attitude.</p>
<p class="tx">But other reactions are much less pleasant, and they are good illustrations of the confusion between sociological and logical links. For example, the <span class="epub-i">New York Times</span> presented the “Sokal affair” as a debate between conservatives who believe in objectivity, at least as a goal, and leftists who deny it. Obviously, the situation is more complex. Not all those on the political left reject the goal (however imperfectly realized) of objectivity<a href="note.html#chapter12-272" id="cha-272"><span class="epub-sup">272</span></a>; and there is not, in any case, a simple logical relation between political and epistemological views.<a href="note.html#chapter12-273" id="cha-273"><span class="epub-sup">273</span></a> Other commentators link this story to attacks against “multiculturalism” and “political correctness”. It would take us much too far afield to discuss these questions in detail, but let us emphasize that we in no way reject the openness to other cultures or the respect for minorities that are often ridiculed in these kinds of attacks.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Why Does It Matter?</span></p>
<p class="ep">The concept of “truth” as something dependent upon facts largely outside human control has been one of the ways in which philosophy hitherto has inculcated the necessary element of humility. When this check upon pride is removed, a further step is taken on the road towards a certain kind of madness—the intoxication of power which invaded philosophy with Fichte, and to which modern men, whether philosophers or not, are prone. I am persuaded that this intoxication is the greatest danger of our time, and that any philosophy which, however unintentionally, contributes to it is increasing the danger of vast social disaster.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Bertrand Russell, History of Western Philosophy (1961a, p. 782)</span></p>
<p class="stx">Why spend so much time exposing these abuses? Do the postmodernists represent a real danger? Certainly not for the natural sciences, at least not at present. The problems faced today by the natural sciences concern primarily the financing of research, and in particular the threat posed to scientific objectivity when public funding is increasingly replaced by private sponsorship. But postmodernism has nothing to do with this.<a href="note.html#chapter12-274" id="cha-274"><span class="epub-sup">274</span></a> It is, rather, the <span class="epub-i">social</span> sciences that suffer when fashionable nonsense and word games displace the critical and rigorous analysis of social realities.</p>
<p class="tx">Postmodernism has three principal negative effects: a waste of time in the human sciences, a cultural confusion that favors obscurantism, and a weakening of the political left.</p>
<p class="tx">First of all, postmodern discourse, exemplified by the texts we quote, functions in part as a dead end in which some sectors of the humanities and social sciences have gotten lost. No research, whether on the natural or the social world, can progress on a basis that is both conceptually confused and radically detached from empirical evidence.</p>
<p class="tx">It could be argued that the authors of the texts quoted here have no real impact on research because their lack of professionalism is well-known in academic circles. This is only partly true: it depends on the authors, the countries, the fields of study, and the eras. For example, the works of Barnes-Bloor and Latour have had an undeniable influence in the sociology of science, even if they have never been hegemonic. The same holds true for Lacan and Deleuze-Guattari in certain areas of literary theory and cultural studies, and for Irigaray in women’s studies.</p>
<p class="tx">What is worse, in our opinion, is the adverse effect that abandoning clear thinking and clear writing has on teaching and culture. Students learn to repeat and to embellish discourses that they only barely understand. They can even, if they are lucky, make an academic career out of it by becoming expert in the manipulation of an erudite jargon.<a href="note.html#chapter12-275" id="cha-275"><span class="epub-sup">275</span></a> After all, one of us managed, after only three months of study, to master the postmodern lingo well enough to publish an article in a prestigious journal. As commentator Katha Pollitt astutely noted, “the comedy of the Sokal incident is that it suggests that even the postmodernists don’t really understand one another’s writing and make their way through the text by moving from one familiar name or notion to the next like a frog jumping across a murky pond by way of lily pads.”<a href="note.html#chapter12-276" id="cha-276"><span class="epub-sup">276</span></a> The deliberately obscure discourses of postmodernism, and the intellectual dishonesty they engender, poison a part of intellectual life and strengthen the facile anti-intellectualism that is already all too widespread in the general public.</p>
<p class="tx">The lackadaisical attitude toward scientific rigor that one finds in Lacan, Kristeva, Baudrillard, and Deleuze had an undeniable success in France during the 1970s and is still remarkably influential there.<a href="note.html#chapter12-277" id="cha-277"><span class="epub-sup">277</span></a> This way of thinking spread outside France, notably in the English-speaking world, during the 1980s and 1990s. Conversely, cognitive relativism developed during the 1970s mostly in the English-speaking world (for example, with the beginning of the “strong programme”) and spread later to France.</p>
<p class="tx">These two attitudes are, of course, conceptually distinct; one can be adopted with or without the other. However, they are indirectly linked: if anything, or almost anything, can be read into the content of scientific discourse, then why should anyone take science seriously as an objective account of the world? Conversely, if one adopts a relativist philosophy, then arbitrary comments on scientific theories become legitimate. Relativism and sloppiness are therefore mutually reinforcing.</p>
<p class="txs">But the most serious cultural consequences of relativism come from its application to the social sciences. The British historian Eric Hobsbawm has eloquently decried</p>
<p class="ex">the rise of “postmodernist” intellectual fashions in Western universities, particularly in departments of literature and anthropology, which imply that all “facts” claiming objective existence are simply intellectual constructions. In short, that there is no clear difference between fact and fiction. But there is, and for historians, even for the most militantly antipositivist ones among us, the ability to distinguish between the two is absolutely fundamental. (Hobsbawm 1993, p. 63)</p>
<p class="stni">Hobsbawm goes on to show how rigorous historical work can refute the fictions propounded by reactionary nationalists in India, Israel, the Balkans, and elsewhere, and how the postmodernist attitude disarms us in the face of these threats.</p>
<p class="tx">At a time when superstitions, obscurantism, and nationalist and religious fanaticism are spreading in many parts of the world—including the “developed” West—it is irresponsible, to say the least, to treat with such casualness what has historically been the principal defense against these follies, namely a rational vision of the world. It is doubtless not the intention of postmodernist authors to favor obscurantism, but it is an inevitable consequence of their approach.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, for all those of us who identify with the political left, postmodernism has specific negative consequences. First of all, the extreme focus on language and the elitism linked to the use of a pretentious jargon contribute to enclosing intellectuals in sterile debates and to isolating them from social movements taking place outside their ivory tower. When progressive students arriving on American campuses learn that the most radical idea (even politically) is to adopt a thoroughly skeptical attitude and to immerse oneself completely in textual analysis, their energy—which could be fruitfully employed in research and organizing—is squandered. Second, the persistence of confused ideas and obscure discourses in some parts of the left tends to discredit the entire left; and the right does not pass up the opportunity to exploit this connection demagogically.<a href="note.html#chapter12-278" id="cha-278"><span class="epub-sup">278</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">But the most important problem is that any possibility of a social critique that could reach those who are not already convinced—a necessity, given the present infinitesimal size of the American left—becomes logically impossible, due to the subjectivist presuppositions.<a href="note.html#chapter12-279" id="cha-279"><span class="epub-sup">279</span></a> If all discourses are merely “stories” or “narrations”, and none is more objective or truthful than another, then one must concede that the worst sexist or racist prejudices and the most reactionary socio-economic theories are “equally valid”, at least as descriptions or analyses of the real world (assuming that one admits the existence of a real world). Clearly, relativism is an extremely weak foundation on which to build a criticism of the existing social order.</p>
<p class="tx">If intellectuals, particularly those on the left, wish to make a positive contribution to the evolution of society, they can do so above all by clarifying the prevailing ideas and by demystifying the dominant discourses, not by adding their own mystifications. A mode of thought does not become “critical” simply by attributing that label to itself, but by virtue of its content.</p>
<p class="tx">To be sure, intellectuals tend to exaggerate their impact on the larger culture, and we want to avoid falling into this trap. We think, nevertheless, that the ideas—even the most abstruse ones—taught and debated within universities have, over time, cultural effects beyond academia. Bertrand Russell undoubtedly exaggerated when he denounced the perverse social consequences of confusion and subjectivism, but his fears were not entirely unfounded.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">What Next?</span></p>
<p class="tni">“A spectre is haunting U.S. intellectual life: the spectre of Left Conservatism.” So proclaimed the announcement for a recent conference at the University of California-Santa Cruz, where we and others<a href="note.html#chapter12-280" id="cha-280"><span class="epub-sup">280</span></a> were criticized for our opposition to “antifoundationalist [i.e. postmodernist] theoretical work” and—horror of horrors—for “an attempt at consensus-building … founded on notions of the real”. We were portrayed as socially conservative Marxists trying to marginalize feminist, gay, and racial-justice politics, and as sharing the values of Rush Limbaugh.<a href="note.html#chapter12-281" id="cha-281"><span class="epub-sup">281</span></a> Might these lurid accusations symbolize, albeit in an extreme way, what has gone wrong with postmodernism?</p>
<p class="tx">Throughout this book, we have defended the idea that there is such a thing as evidence and that facts matter. However, many questions of vital interest—notably those concerning the future—cannot be answered conclusively on the basis of evidence and reason, and they lead human beings to indulge in (more-or-less-informed) speculation. We would like to end this book with a bit of speculation of our own, concerning the future of postmodernism. As we have repeatedly stressed, postmodernism is such a complicated network of ideas—with only weak logical links between them—that it is difficult to characterize it more precisely than as a vague zeitgeist. Nevertheless, the roots of this zeitgeist are not hard to identify, and go back to the early 1960s: challenges to empiricist philosophies of science with Kuhn, critiques of humanist philosophies of history with Foucault, disillusionment with grand schemes for political change. Like all new intellectual currents, postmodernism, in its inchoate phase, met with resistance from the old guard. But new ideas have the privilege of youth playing for them, and the resistance turned out to be vain.</p>
<p class="tx">Almost forty years later, revolutionaries have aged and marginality has become institutionalized. Ideas that contained some truth, if properly understood, have degenerated into a vulgate that mixes bizarre confusions with overblown banalities. It seems to us that postmodernism, whatever usefulness it originally had as a corrective to hardened orthodoxies, has lived this out and is now running its natural course. Although the name was not ideally chosen to invite a succession (what can come after <span class="epub-i">post</span>-?), we are under the inescapable impression that times are changing. One sign is that the challenge comes nowadays not only from the rearguard, but also from people who are neither die-hard positivists nor old-fashioned Marxists, and who understand the problems encountered by science, rationality, and traditional leftist politics—but who believe that criticism of the past should enlighten the future, not lead to contemplation of the ashes.<a href="note.html#chapter12-282" id="cha-282"><span class="epub-sup">282</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">What will come after postmodernism? Since the principal lesson to be learned from the past is that predicting the future is hazardous, we can only list our fears and our hopes. One possibility is a backlash leading to some form of dogmatism, mysticism (e.g. New Age), or religious fundamentalism. This may appear unlikely, at least in academic circles, but the demise of reason has been radical enough to pave the way for a more extreme irrationalism. In this case intellectual life would go from bad to worse. A second possibility is that intellectuals will become reluctant (at least for a decade or two) to attempt any thoroughgoing critique of the existing social order, and will either become its servile advocates—as some formerly leftist French intellectuals did after 1968—or retreat from political engagement entirely. Our hopes, however, go in a different direction: the emergence of an intellectual culture that would be rationalist but not dogmatic, scientifically minded but not scientistic, open-minded but not frivolous, and politically progressive but not sectarian. But this, of course, is only a hope, and perhaps only a dream.</p>
