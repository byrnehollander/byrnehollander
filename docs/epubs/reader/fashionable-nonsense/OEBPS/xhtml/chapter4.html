<p class="ct" id="ch4"><span class="epub-b">4. Intermezzo: Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science</span></p>
<p class="ep">I did not write this work merely with the aim of setting the exegetical record straight. My larger target is those contemporaries who—in repeated acts of wish-fulfillment—have appropriated conclusions from the philosophy of science and put them to work in aid of a variety of social cum political causes for which those conclusions are ill adapted. Feminists, religious apologists (including “creation scientists”), counterculturalists, neo-conservatives, and a host of other curious fellow-travelers have claimed to find crucial grist for their mills in, for instance, the avowed incommensurability and underdetermination of scientific theories. The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is—second only to American political campaigns—the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time.</p>

<p class="co">Since much postmodern discourse flirts with one form or another of cognitive relativism or invokes arguments that can support it, it seems useful at this point to include an epistemological discussion. We are aware that we will be dealing with difficult problems concerning the nature of knowledge and objectivity, which have worried philosophers for centuries. It is not necessary to share our philosophical positions in order to agree with the rest of what we say. In this chapter we shall criticize ideas that are in our view erroneous, but which are sometimes (not always) so for subtle reasons, contrary to the texts we criticize in the rest of this book. Our philosophical argumentation will, in any case, be rather minimalist; we shall not enter into the more delicate philosophical debates between, for example, moderate forms of realism and instrumentalism.</p>
<p class="tx">We are concerned here with a potpourri of ideas, often poorly formulated, that go under the generic name of “relativism” and are nowadays rather influential in some sectors of the academic humanities and social sciences. This relativist zeitgeist originates partly from contemporary works in the philosophy of science, such as Thomas Kuhn’s <span class="epub-i">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</span> and Paul Feyerabend’s <span class="epub-i">Against Method,</span> and partly from extrapolations of these philosophers’ work by their successors.<a href="note.html#chapter4-49" id="cha-49"><span class="epub-sup">49</span></a> Of course, we do not purport to examine the entire work of the authors discussed in this chapter; that would be an unmanageable task. Rather, we shall limit ourselves to an analysis of certain texts that illustrate rather widespread ideas. We shall show that these texts are often ambiguous and can be read in at least two distinct ways: a “moderate” reading, which leads to claims that are either worth discussing or else true but trivial; and a “radical” reading, which leads to claims that are surprising but false. Unfortunately, the radical interpretation is often taken not only as the “correct” interpretation of the original text but also as a well-established fact (“X has shown that…”)—a conclusion that we shall sharply criticize. It might, of course, be argued that no one holds this radical interpretation; and all the better if that is true. But the numerous discussions we have had during which the theory-ladenness of observation, the underdetermination of theory by evidence or the alleged incommensurability of paradigms have been put forward in order to support relativist positions leave us rather skeptical. And to show that we are not criticizing a figment of our imagination, we shall give, at the end of this chapter, a few practical examples of the relativism that is widespread in the United States, in Europe, and in parts of the Third World.</p>
<p class="tx">Roughly speaking, we shall use the term “relativism” to designate any philosophy that claims that the truth or falsity of a statement is relative to an individual or to a social group. One may distinguish different forms of relativism according to the nature of the statement in question: <span class="epub-i">cognitive</span> or <span class="epub-i">epistemic</span> relativism when one is dealing with an assertion of fact (that is, about what exists or is claimed to exist); <span class="epub-i">moral</span> or <span class="epub-i">ethical</span> relativism when one is dealing with a value judgment (about what is good or bad, desirable or pernicious); and <span class="epub-i">aesthetic</span> relativism when one is dealing with an artistic judgment (about what is beautiful or ugly, pleasant or unpleasant). Here we shall be concerned only with <span class="epub-i">epistemic</span> relativism and not with moral or aesthetic relativism, which raise very different issues.</p>
<p class="tx">We are well aware that we will be criticized for our lack of formal philosophical training. In the Introduction we explained why this sort of objection leaves us cold, but it seems particularly irrelevant here. After all, there is no doubt that the relativist attitude is at odds with scientists’ idea of their own practice. While scientists try, as best they can, to obtain an objective view of (certain aspects of) the world<a href="note.html#chapter4-50" id="cha-50"><span class="epub-sup">50</span></a>, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion. We are thus dealing with a fundamental conflict. And as physicists who have long pondered the foundations of our discipline and of scientific knowledge in general, we think it important to try to give a reasoned answer to the relativist objections, even though neither of us holds a diploma in philosophy.</p>
<p class="tx">We shall start by sketching our attitude toward scientific knowledge<a href="note.html#chapter4-51" id="cha-51"><span class="epub-sup">51</span></a>, and shall then review briefly some aspects of twentieth-century epistemology (Popper, Quine, Kuhn, Feyerabend); our aim will mostly be to disentangle some of the confusions concerning notions such as “underdetermination” and “incommensurability”. Finally, we shall examine critically some recent tendencies in the sociology of science (Barnes, Bloor, Latour) and shall give some practical examples of the effects of contemporary relativism.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Solipsism and Radical Skepticism</span></p>
<p class="ep">When my brain excites in my soul the sensation of a tree, or of a house, I pronounce, without hesitation, that a tree, or a house, really exists out of me, of which I know the place, the size, and other properties. Accordingly, we find neither man nor beast who calls this truth in question. If a peasant should take it into his head to conceive such a doubt, and should say, for example, he does not believe that his bailiff exists, though he stands in his presence, he would be taken for a madman, and with good reason; but when a philosopher advances such sentiments, he expects we should admire his knowledge and sagacity, which infinitely surpass the apprehensions of the vulgar.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Leonhard Euler (1997 [1761], pp. 428–429)</span></p>
<p class="stx">Let us start at the beginning. How can one possibly hope to attain an objective (albeit approximate and incomplete) knowledge of the world? We never have direct access to the world; we have direct access only to our sensations. How do we know that there even <span class="epub-i">exists</span> anything outside of those sensations?</p>
<p class="tx">The answer, of course, is that we have no <span class="epub-i">proof;</span> it is simply a perfectly reasonable hypothesis. The most natural way to explain the persistence of our sensations (in particular, the unpleasant ones) is to suppose that they are caused by agents outside our consciousness. We can almost always change at will the sensations that are pure products of our imagination, but we cannot stop a war, stave off a lion, or start a broken-down car by pure thought alone. Nevertheless—and it is important to emphasize this—this argument <span class="epub-i">does not refute</span> solipsism. If anyone insists that he is a “harpsichord playing solo” (Diderot), there is no way to convince him of his error. However, we have never met a sincere solipsist and we doubt that any exist.<a href="note.html#chapter4-52" id="cha-52"><span class="epub-sup">52</span></a> This illustrates an important principle that we shall use several times in this chapter: <span class="epub-i">the mere fact that an idea is irrefutable does not imply that there is any reason to believe it is true.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Another position that one sometimes encounters, in place of solipsism, is radical skepticism: “Of course there exists an external world, but it is impossible for me to obtain any reliable knowledge of that world.” In essence the argument is the same as that of the solipsist: I have immediate access only to my sensations; how can I know whether they <span class="epub-i">accurately reflect</span> reality? To be certain that they do, I would need to invoke an <span class="epub-i">a priori</span> argument, such as the proof of the existence of a benevolent deity in Descartes’ philosophy; and such arguments have fallen into disfavor in modern philosophy, for all sorts of good reasons that we need not rehearse here.</p>
<p class="txs">This problem, like many others, was very well formulated by Hume:</p>
<p class="ex">It is a question of fact, whether the perceptions of the senses be produced by external objects, resembling them: how shall this question be determined? By experience surely; as all other questions of a like nature. But here experience is, and must be entirely silent. The mind has never anything present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any experience of their connexion with objects. The supposition of such a connexion is, therefore, without any foundation in reasoning. (Hume 1988 [1748], p. 138: <span class="epub-i">An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,</span> Section XII, Part I)</p>
<p class="stx">What attitude should one adopt toward radical skepticism? The key observation is that such skepticism applies to <span class="epub-i">all</span> our knowledge: not only to the existence of atoms, electrons or genes, but also to fact that blood circulates in our veins, that the Earth is (approximately) round, and that at birth we emerged from our mother’s womb. Indeed, even the most commonplace knowledge in our everyday lives—there is a glass of water in front of me on the table—depends entirely on the supposition that our perceptions do not <span class="epub-i">systematically</span> mislead us and that they are indeed produced by external objects that, in some way, resemble those perceptions.<a href="note.html#chapter4-53" id="cha-53"><span class="epub-sup">53</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">The universality of Humean skepticism is also its weakness. Of course, it is irrefutable. But since no one is systematically skeptical (when he or she is sincere) with respect to ordinary knowledge, one ought to ask <span class="epub-i">why</span> skepticism is rejected in that domain and <span class="epub-i">why</span> it would nevertheless be valid when applied elsewhere, for instance, to scientific knowledge. Now, the reason why we reject systematic skepticism in everyday life is more or less obvious and is similar to the reason we reject solipsism. The best way to account for the coherence of our experience is to suppose that the outside world corresponds, at least approximately, to the image of it provided by our senses.<a href="note.html#chapter4-54" id="cha-54"><span class="epub-sup">54</span></a></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Science As Practice</span></p>
<p class="ep">For my part, I have no doubt that, although progressive changes are to be expected in physics, the present doctrines are likely to be nearer to the truth than any rival doctrines now before the world. Science is at no moment quite right, but it is seldom quite wrong, and has, as a rule, a better chance of being right than the theories of the unscientific. It is, therefore, rational to accept it hypothetically.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Bertrand Russell, My Philosophical Development (1995 [1959], p. 13)</span></p>
<p class="stx">Once the general problems of solipsism and radical skepticism have been set aside, we can get down to work. Let us suppose that we are able to obtain some more-or-less reliable knowledge of the world, at least in everyday life. We can then ask: <span class="epub-i">To what extent</span> are our senses reliable or not? To answer this question, we can compare sense impressions among themselves and vary certain parameters of our everyday experience. We can map out in this way, step by step, a practical rationality. When this is done systematically and with sufficient precision, science can begin.</p>
<p class="tx">For us, the scientific method is not radically different from the rational attitude in everyday life or in other domains of human knowledge. Historians, detectives, and plumbers—indeed, all human beings—use the same basic methods of induction, deduction, and assessment of evidence as do physicists or biochemists. Modern science tries to carry out these operations in a more careful and systematic way, by using controls and statistical tests, insisting on replication, and so forth. Moreover, scientific measurements are often much more precise than everyday observations; they allow us to discover hitherto unknown phenomena; and they often conflict with “common sense”. But the conflict is at the level of conclusions, not the basic approach.<a href="note.html#chapter4-55" id="cha-55"><span class="epub-sup">55</span></a><span class="epub-sup">,</span><a href="note.html#chapter4-56" id="cha-56"><span class="epub-sup">56</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">The main reason for believing scientific theories (at least the best-verified ones) is that they explain the coherence of our experience. Let us be precise: here “experience” refers to <span class="epub-i">all</span> our observations, including the results of laboratory experiments whose goal is to test quantitatively (sometimes to incredible precision) the predictions of scientific theories. To cite just one example, quantum electrodynamics predicts that the magnetic moment of the electron has the value<a href="note.html#chapter4-57" id="cha-57"><span class="epub-sup">57</span></a></p>
<p class="ex-ctr">1.001 159 652 201 ± 0.000 000 000 030 ,</p>
<p class="stnis">where the “±” denotes the uncertainties in the theoretical computation (which involves several approximations). A recent experiment gives the result</p>
<p class="ex-ctr">1.001 159 652 188 ± 0.000 000 000 004 ,</p>
<p class="stni">where the “±” denotes the experimental uncertainties.<a href="note.html#chapter4-58" id="cha-58"><span class="epub-sup">58</span></a> This agreement between theory and experiment, when combined with thousands of other similar though less spectacular ones, would be a miracle if science said nothing true—or at least <span class="epub-i">approximately</span> true—about the world. The experimental confirmations of the best-established scientific theories, taken together, are evidence that we really have acquired an objective (albeit approximate and incomplete) knowledge of the natural world.<a href="note.html#chapter4-59" id="cha-59"><span class="epub-sup">59</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Having reached this point in the discussion, the radical skeptic or relativist will ask what distinguishes science from other types of discourse about reality—religions or myths, for example, or pseudo-sciences such as astrology—and, above all, what <span class="epub-i">criteria</span> are used to make such a distinction. Our answer is nuanced. First of all, there are some general (but basically negative) epistemological principles, which go back at least to the seventeenth century: to be skeptical of <span class="epub-i">a priori</span> arguments, revelation, sacred texts, and arguments from authority. Moreover, the experience accumulated during three centuries of scientific practice has given us a series of more-or-less general methodological principles—for example, to replicate experiments, to use controls, to test medicines in double-blind protocols—that can be justified by rational arguments. However, we do not claim that these principles can be codified in a definitive way, nor that the list is exhaustive. In other words, there does not exist (at least at present) a complete codification of scientific rationality, and we seriously doubt that one could ever exist. After all, the future is inherently unpredictable; rationality is always an adaptation to a new situation. Nevertheless—and this is the main difference between us and the radical skeptics—we think that well-developed scientific theories are in general supported by good arguments, but the rationality of those arguments must be analyzed case-by-case.<a href="note.html#chapter4-60" id="cha-60"><span class="epub-sup">60</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">To illustrate this, let us consider an example that is in a certain sense intermediate between scientific and ordinary knowledge, namely criminal investigations.<a href="note.html#chapter4-61" id="cha-61"><span class="epub-sup">61</span></a> There are some cases in which even the hardiest skeptic will find it difficult to doubt, in practice, that the culprit has really been found: one may, after all, possess the weapon, fingerprints, DNA evidence, documents, a motive, and so forth. Nevertheless, the path leading to those discoveries can be very complicated: the investigator has to make decisions (on the leads to follow, on the evidence to seek) and draw provisional inferences, in situations of incomplete information. Nearly every investigation involves inferring the unobserved (who committed the crime) from the observed. And here, as in science, some inferences are more rational than others. The investigation could have been botched, or the “evidence” might simply have been fabricated by the police. But there is no way to decide <span class="epub-i">a priori,</span> independently of the circumstances, what distinguishes a good investigation from a bad one. Nor can anyone give an absolute guarantee that a particular investigation has yielded the correct result. Moreover, no one can write a definitive treatise on <span class="epub-i">The Logic of Criminal Investigation.</span> Nevertheless—and this is the main point—no one doubts that, for some investigations at least (the best ones), the result does indeed correspond to reality. Furthermore, history has permitted us to develop certain rules for conducting an investigation: no one believes anymore in trial by fire, and we doubt the reliability of confessions obtained under torture. It is crucial to compare testimonies, to cross-examine witnesses, to search for physical evidence, etc. Even though there does not exist a methodology based on unquestionable <span class="epub-i">a priori</span> reasoning, these rules (and many others) are not arbitrary. They are rational and are based on a detailed analysis of prior experience. In our view, the “scientific method” is not radically different from this kind of approach.</p>
<p class="tx">The absence of any “absolutist” criteria of rationality, independent of all circumstances, implies also there is no <span class="epub-i">general</span> justification of the principle of induction (another problem going back to Hume). Quite simply, some inductions are justified and others are not; or, to be more precise, some inductions are more reasonable and others are less so. Everything depends on the case at hand: to take a classic philosophical example, the fact that we have seen the Sun rise every day, together with all our astronomical knowledge, gives us good reasons to believe that it will rise tomorrow. But this does not imply that it will rise ten billion years from now (indeed, current astrophysical theories predict that it will exhaust its fuel before then).</p>
<p class="tx">In a sense, we always return to Hume’s problem: No statement about the real world can ever literally be <span class="epub-i">proven;</span> but to use the eminently appropriate expression from Anglo-Saxon law, it can sometimes be proven beyond any <span class="epub-i">reasonable</span> doubt. The unreasonable doubt subsists.</p>
<p class="txs">If we have spent so much time on these rather elementary remarks, it is because much of the relativist drift that we shall criticize has a double origin:</p>
<p class="bls">• Part of twentieth-century epistemology (the Vienna Circle, Popper, and others) has attempted to formalize the scientific method.</p>
<p class="bl">• The partial failure of this attempt has led, in some circles, to an attitude of unreasonable skepticism.</p>
<p class="stni">In the rest of this chapter, we intend to show that a series of relativist arguments concerning scientific knowledge are either (a) valid critiques of some attempts to formalize the scientific method, which do not, however, in any way undermine the rationality of the scientific enterprise; or (b) mere reformulations, in one guise or another, of Humean radical skepticism.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Epistemology in Crisis</span></p>
<p class="ep">Science without epistemology is—insofar as it is thinkable at all—primitive and muddled. However, no sooner has the epistemologist, who is seeking a clear system, fought his way through such a system, than he is inclined to interpret the thought-content of science in the sense of his system and to reject whatever does not fit into his system. The scientist, however, cannot afford to carry his striving for epistemological systematic that far.… He therefore must appear to the systematic epistemologist as an unscrupulous opportunist.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Albert Einstein (1949, p. 684)</span></p>
<p class="stx">Much contemporary skepticism claims to find support in the writings of philosophers such as Quine, Kuhn, or Feyerabend who have called into question the epistemology of the first half of the twentieth century. This epistemology is indeed in crisis. In order to understand the nature and the origin of the crisis and the impact that it may have on the philosophy of science, let us go back to Popper.<a href="note.html#chapter4-62" id="cha-62"><span class="epub-sup">62</span></a> Of course, Popper is not a relativist, quite the contrary. He is nevertheless a good starting point, first of all because many of the modern developments in epistemology (Kuhn, Feyerabend) arose in reaction to him, and secondly because, while we disagree strongly with some of the conclusions reached by Popper’s critics such as Feyerabend, it is nevertheless true that a significant part of our problems can be traced to ambiguities or inadequacies in Popper’s <span class="epub-i">The Logic of Scientific Discovery.</span><a href="note.html#chapter4-63" id="cha-63"><span class="epub-sup">63</span></a> It is important to understand the limitations of this work in order to face more effectively the irrationalist drift created by the critiques it provoked.</p>
<p class="tx">Popper’s basic ideas are well known. He wants, first of all, to give a criterion for demarcating between scientific and nonscientific theories, and he thinks he has found it in the notion of <span class="epub-i">falsifiability:</span> in order to be scientific, a theory must make predictions that can, in principle, be false in the real world. For Popper, theories such as astrology or psychoanalysis avoid subjecting themselves to such a test, either by not making precise predictions or by arranging their statements in an <span class="epub-i">ad hoc</span> fashion in order to accommodate empirical results whenever they contradict the theory.<a href="note.html#chapter4-64" id="cha-64"><span class="epub-sup">64</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">If a theory is falsifiable, hence scientific, it may be subjected to attempts at <span class="epub-i">falsification.</span> That is, one may compare the theory’s empirical predictions with observations or experiments; and if the latter contradict the predictions, it follows that the theory is false and must be rejected. This emphasis on falsification (as opposed to verification) underlines, according to Popper, a crucial asymmetry: one can never prove that a theory is <span class="epub-i">true,</span> because it makes, in general, an infinite number of empirical predictions, of which only a finite subset can ever be tested; but one can nevertheless prove that a theory is <span class="epub-i">false,</span> because, to do that, a single (reliable) observation contradicting the theory suffices.<a href="note.html#chapter4-65" id="cha-65"><span class="epub-sup">65</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">The Popperian scheme—falsifiability and falsification—is not a bad one, if it is taken with a grain of salt. But numerous difficulties spring up as soon as one tries to take falsificationist doctrine literally. It may appear attractive to abandon the uncertainty of verification in favor of the certainty of falsification. But this approach runs into two problems: by abandoning verification, one pays too high a price; and one fails to obtain what is promised, because falsification is much less certain than it seems.</p>
<p class="txs">The first difficulty concerns the status of scientific induction. When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher subjective probability. The degree of likelihood depends, of course, upon the circumstances: the quality of the experiment, the unexpectedness of the result, etc. But Popper will have none of this: throughout his life, he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of “confirmation” of a theory, or even of its “probability”. He wrote:</p>
<p class="ex"><span class="epub-i">Are we rationally justified in reasoning from repeated instances of which we have experience to instances we have had no experience?</span> Hume’s unrelenting answer is: No, we are not justified … My own view is that Hume’s answer to this problem is right. (Popper 1974, pp. 1018–1019, italics in the original)<a href="note.html#chapter4-66" id="cha-66"><span class="epub-sup">66</span></a></p>
<p class="stni">Obviously, every induction is an inference from the observed to the unobserved, and no such inference can be justified using solely <span class="epub-i">deductive</span> logic. But, as we have seen, if this argument were to be taken seriously—if rationality were to consist only of deductive logic—it would imply also that there is no good reason to believe that the Sun will rise tomorrow, and yet no one <span class="epub-i">really</span> expects the Sun not to rise.</p>
<p class="tx">With his method of falsification, Popper thinks that he has solved Hume’s problem<a href="note.html#chapter4-67" id="cha-67"><span class="epub-sup">67</span></a>, but his solution, taken literally, is a purely negative one: we can be certain that some theories are false, but never that a theory is true or even probable. Clearly, this “solution” is unsatisfactory from a scientific point of view. In particular, at least one of the roles of science is to make predictions on which other people (engineers, doctors,…) can reliably base their activities, and all such predictions rely on some form of induction.</p>
<p class="tx">Besides, the history of science teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of their successes. For example, on the basis of Newtonian mechanics, physicists have been able to deduce a great number of both astronomical and terrestrial motions, in excellent agreement with observations. Moreover, the credibility of Newtonian mechanics was reinforced by correct predictions such as the return of Halley’s comet in 1759<a href="note.html#chapter4-68" id="cha-68"><span class="epub-sup">68</span></a> and by spectacular discoveries such as finding Neptune in 1846 where Le Verrier and Adams predicted it should be.<a href="note.html#chapter4-69" id="cha-69"><span class="epub-sup">69</span></a> It is hard to believe that such a simple theory could predict so precisely <span class="epub-i">entirely new</span> phenomena if it were not at least approximately true.</p>
<p class="tx">The second difficulty with Popper’s epistemology is that falsification is much more complicated than it seems.<a href="note.html#chapter4-70" id="cha-70"><span class="epub-sup">70</span></a> To see this, let us take once again the example of Newtonian mechanics<a href="note.html#chapter4-71" id="cha-71"><span class="epub-sup">71</span></a>, understood as the combination of two laws: the law of motion, according to which force is equal to mass times acceleration; and the law of universal gravitation, according to which the force of attraction between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them. In what sense is this theory falsifiable? By itself, it doesn’t predict much; indeed, a great variety of motions are <span class="epub-i">compatible</span> with the laws of Newtonian mechanics and even <span class="epub-i">deducible</span> from them, if one makes appropriate assumptions about the masses of the various celestial bodies. For example, Newton’s famous deduction of Kepler’s laws of planetary motion requires certain <span class="epub-i">additional assumptions,</span> which are logically independent of the laws of Newtonian mechanics, principally that the masses of the planets are small relative to the mass of the Sun: this implies that the mutual interactions between the planets can be neglected, in a first approximation. But this hypothesis, while reasonable, is by no means self-evident: the planets could be made of a very dense material, in which case the additional hypothesis would fail. Or there could exist a large amount of invisible matter affecting the motion of the planets.<a href="note.html#chapter4-72" id="cha-72"><span class="epub-sup">72</span></a> Moreover, the interpretation of any astronomical observation depends on certain theoretical propositions, in particular on optical hypotheses concerning the functioning of telescopes and the propagation of light through space. The same is true, in fact, for any observation: for example, when one “measures” an electrical current, what one really sees is the position of a needle on a screen (or numbers on a digital readout), which is interpreted, in accordance with our theories, as indicating the presence and the magnitude of a current.<a href="note.html#chapter4-73" id="cha-73"><span class="epub-sup">73</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">It follows that scientific propositions cannot be falsified one by one, because to deduce from them any empirical proposition whatsoever, it is necessary to make numerous additional assumptions, if only on the way measuring devices work; moreover, these hypotheses are often implicit. The American philosopher Quine has expressed this idea in a rather radical fashion:</p>
<p class="ex">[O]ur statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually but only as a corporate body.… Taken collectively, science has its double dependence upon language and experience; but this duality is not significantly traceable into the statements of science taken one by one.…</p>
<p class="exi">The idea of defining a symbol in use was … an advance over the impossible term-by-term empiricism of Locke and Hume. The statement, rather than the term, came with Bentham to be recognized as the unit accountable to an empiricist critique. But what I am now urging is that even in taking the statement as unit we have drawn our grid too finely. The unit of empirical significance is the whole of science. (Quine 1980 [1953], pp. 41–42)<a href="note.html#chapter4-74" id="cha-74"><span class="epub-sup">74</span></a></p>
<p class="stx">What can one reply to such objections? First of all, it must be emphasized that scientists, in their practice, are perfectly aware of the problem. Each time an experiment contradicts a theory, scientists ask themselves a host of questions: Is the error due to the way the experiment was performed or analyzed? Is it due to the theory itself, or to some additional assumption? The experiment itself never dictates what must be done. The notion (what Quine calls the “empiricist dogma”) that scientific propositions can be tested one by one belongs to a fairy tale about science.</p>
<p class="tx">But Quine’s assertions demand serious qualifications.<a href="note.html#chapter4-75" id="cha-75"><span class="epub-sup">75</span></a> In practice, experience is not given; we do not simply contemplate the world and then interpret it. We perform specific experiments, motivated by our theories, precisely in order to test the different parts of those theories, if possible independently of one another or, at least, in different combinations. We use a <span class="epub-i">set</span> of tests, some of which serve only to check that the measuring devices indeed work as expected (by applying them to well-known situations). And, just as it is the totality of the relevant theoretical propositions that is subjected to a falsification test, so it is the totality of our empirical observations that constrains our theoretical interpretations. For example, while it is true that our astronomical knowledge depends upon hypotheses about optics, these hypotheses cannot be modified in an arbitrary way, because they can be tested, at least in part, by numerous <span class="epub-i">independent</span> experiments.</p>
<p class="tx">We have not, however, reached the end of our troubles. If one takes the falsificationist doctrine literally, one should declare that Newtonian mechanics was falsified already in the mid-nineteenth century by the anomalous behavior of Mercury’s orbit.<a href="note.html#chapter4-76" id="cha-76"><span class="epub-sup">76</span></a> For a strict Popperian, the idea of putting aside certain difficulties (such as the orbit of Mercury) in the hope that they will be temporary amounts to an illegitimate strategy aimed at evading falsification. However, if one takes into account the context, one may very well maintain that it is <span class="epub-i">rational</span> to proceed in this way, at least for a certain period of time—otherwise science would be impossible. There are always experiments or observations that cannot be fully explained, or that even contradict the theory, which are put aside awaiting better days. Given the immense successes of Newtonian mechanics, it would have been unreasonable to reject it because of a single prediction (apparently) refuted by observations, since this disagreement could have all sorts of other explanations.<a href="note.html#chapter4-77" id="cha-77"><span class="epub-sup">77</span></a> Science is a rational enterprise, but difficult to codify.</p>
<p class="tx">Without a doubt, Popper’s epistemology contains some valid insights: the emphasis on falsifiability and falsification is salutary, provided it is not taken to extremes (e.g. the blanket rejection of induction). In particular, when comparing radically different endeavors such as astronomy and astrology, it is useful, to some extent, to employ Popperian criteria. But there is no point in demanding that the pseudo-sciences follow strict rules that the scientists themselves do not follow literally (otherwise one exposes oneself to Feyerabend’s critiques, which we shall discuss later).</p>
<p class="tx">It is obvious that, in order to be scientific, a theory must be tested empirically in one way or another—and the more stringent the tests, the better. It is also true that predictions of unexpected phenomena often constitute the most spectacular tests. Finally, it is easier to show that a precise quantitative claim is false than to show that it is true. And it is probably a combination of these three ideas that explains, in part, Popper’s popularity among many scientists. But these ideas are not due to Popper, nor do they constitute what is original in his work. The necessity of empirical tests goes back at least to the seventeenth century, and is simply the lesson of empiricism: the rejection of <span class="epub-i">a priori</span> or revealed truths. Besides, predictions are not always the most powerful tests<a href="note.html#chapter4-78" id="cha-78"><span class="epub-sup">78</span></a>; and those tests may take relatively complex forms, which cannot be reduced to the simple falsification of hypotheses taken one by one.</p>
<p class="tx">All these problems would not be so serious had they not given rise to a strongly irrationalist reaction: some thinkers, notably Feyerabend, reject Popper’s epistemology for many of the reasons just discussed, and then fall into an extreme antiscientific attitude (see below). But the rational arguments in favor of the theory of relativity or the theory of evolution are to be found in the works of Einstein, Darwin, and their successors, not Popper. Thus, even if Popper’s epistemology were entirely false (which is certainly not the case), that would imply nothing concerning the validity of scientific theories.<a href="note.html#chapter4-79" id="cha-79"><span class="epub-sup">79</span></a></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">The Duhem-Quine Thesis: Underdetermination</span></p>
<p class="tni">Another idea, often called the “Duhem-Quine thesis”, is that theories are underdetermined by evidence.<a href="note.html#chapter4-80" id="cha-80"><span class="epub-sup">80</span></a> The set of all our experimental data is finite; but our theories contain, at least potentially, an infinite number of empirical predictions. For example, Newtonian mechanics describes not only how the planets move, but also how a yet-to-be-launched satellite will move. How can one pass from a finite set of data to a potentially infinite set of assertions? Or, to be more precise, is there a unique way of doing this? This is rather like asking whether, given a finite set of points, there is a unique curve that passes through these points. Clearly the answer is no: there are infinitely many curves passing through any given finite set of points. Similarly, there is always a large (even infinite) number of theories compatible with the data—and this, whatever the data and whatever their number.</p>
<p class="tx">There are two ways to react to such a general thesis. The first approach is to apply it systematically to <span class="epub-i">all</span> our beliefs (as one is logically entitled to do). So we would conclude, for example, that, whatever the facts, there will always be just as many suspects at the end of any criminal investigation as there were at the beginning. Clearly, this looks absurd. But it is indeed what can be “shown” using the underdetermination thesis: one can always invent a story (possibly a very bizarre one) in which X is guilty and Y is innocent and in which “the data are accounted for” in an <span class="epub-i">ad hoc</span> fashion. We are simply back to Humean radical skepticism. The weakness of this thesis is again its generality.</p>
<p class="txs">Another way to deal with this problem is to consider the various concrete situations that can occur when one confronts theory with evidence:</p>
<p class="nls">1) One may possess evidence in favor of a given theory that is so strong that to doubt the theory would be almost as unreasonable as to believe in solipsism. For example, we have good reasons to believe that blood circulates, that biological species have evolved, that matter is composed of atoms, and a host of other things. The analogous situation, in a criminal investigation, is that in which one is sure, or almost sure, of having found the culprit.</p>
<p class="nls">2) One may have a number of competing theories, none of which seems totally convincing. For example, the problem of the origin of life provides (at least at present) a good example of such a situation. The analogy in criminal investigations is obviously the case in which there are several plausible suspects but it is unclear which one is really guilty. The situation may also arise in which one has just one theory, which, however, is not very convincing due to the lack of sufficiently powerful tests. In such a case, scientists implicitly apply the underdetermination thesis: since another theory, not yet conceived, might well be the right one, one confers on the sole existing theory a rather low subjective probability.</p>
<p class="nl">3) Finally, one may lack even a single plausible theory that accounts for all the existing data. This is probably the case today for the unification of general relativity with elementary-particle physics, as well as for many other difficult scientific problems.</p>
<p class="stx">Let us come back for a moment to the problem of the curve drawn through a finite number of points. What convinces us most strongly that we found the right curve is, of course, that when we perform additional experiments, the <span class="epub-i">new</span> data fit the <span class="epub-i">old</span> curve. One has to assume implicitly that there is not a cosmic conspiracy in which the real curve is very different from the curve we have drawn, but in which all our data (old and new) happen to fall on the intersection of the two. To take a phrase from Einstein, one must imagine that the Lord is subtle, but not malicious.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Kuhn and the Incommensurability of Paradigms</span></p>
<p class="ep">Much more is known now than was known fifty years ago, and much more was known then than in 1580. So there has been a great accumulation or growth of knowledge in the last four hundred years. This is an extremely well-known fact … So a writer whose position inclined him to deny [it], or even made him at all reluctant to admit it, would inevitably seem, to the philosophers who read him, to be maintaining something extremely implausible.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">David Stove, Popper and After (1982, p. 3)</span></p>
<p class="stx">Let us now turn our attention towards some historical analyses that have apparently provided grist for the mill of contemporary relativism. The most famous of these is undoubtedly Thomas Kuhn’s <span class="epub-i">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.</span><a href="note.html#chapter4-81" id="cha-81"><span class="epub-sup">81</span></a> We shall deal here exclusively with the epistemological aspect of Kuhn’s work, putting aside the details of his historical analyses.<a href="note.html#chapter4-82" id="cha-82"><span class="epub-sup">82</span></a> There is no doubt that Kuhn envisions his work as a historian as having an impact on our conception of scientific activity and thus, at least indirectly, on epistemology.<a href="note.html#chapter4-83" id="cha-83"><span class="epub-sup">83</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Kuhn’s scheme is well known: The bulk of scientific activity—what Kuhn calls “normal science”—takes place within “paradigms”, which define what kinds of problems are studied, what criteria are used to evaluate a solution, and what experimental procedures are deemed acceptable. From time to time, normal science enters into crisis—a “revolutionary” period—and the paradigm changes. For instance, the birth of modern physics with Galileo and Newton constituted a rupture with Aristotle; similarly, in the twentieth century, relativity theory and quantum mechanics have overturned the Newtonian paradigm. Comparable revolutions took place in biology, during the development from a static view of species to the theory of evolution, or from Lamarck to modern genetics.</p>
<p class="txs">This vision of things fits so well with scientists’ perception of their own work that it is difficult to see, at first glance, what is revolutionary in this approach, much less how it could be used for anti-scientific purposes. The problem arises only when one faces the notion of the <span class="epub-i">incommensurability</span> of paradigms. On the one hand, scientists think, in general, that it is possible to decide rationally between competing theories (Newton and Einstein, for example) on the basis of observations and experiments, even if those theories are accorded the status of “paradigms”.<a href="note.html#chapter4-84" id="cha-84"><span class="epub-sup">84</span></a> By contrast, though one can give several meanings to the word “incommensurable” and a good deal of the debate about Kuhn’s work has centered on this question, there is at least one version of the incommensurability thesis that casts doubt on the possibility of rational comparison between competing theories, namely the idea that our experience of the world is radically conditioned by our theories, which in turn depend upon the paradigm.<a href="note.html#chapter4-85" id="cha-85"><span class="epub-sup">85</span></a> For example, Kuhn observes that chemists after Dalton reported chemical compositions as ratios of integers rather than as decimals.<a href="note.html#chapter4-86" id="cha-86"><span class="epub-sup">86</span></a> And while the atomic theory accounted for much of the data available at that time, some experiments gave conflicting results. The conclusion drawn by Kuhn is rather radical:</p>
<p class="ex">Chemists could not, therefore, simply accept Dalton’s theory on the evidence, for much of that was still negative. Instead, even after accepting the theory, they still had to beat nature into line, a process which, in the event, took almost another generation. When it was done, even the percentage composition of well-known compounds was different. The data themselves had changed. That is the last of the senses in which we may want to say that after a revolution scientists work in a different world. (Kuhn 1970, p. 135)</p>
<p class="stni">But what exactly does Kuhn mean by, “they still had to beat nature into line”? Is he suggesting that chemists after Dalton manipulated their data in order to make them agree with the atomic hypothesis, and that their successors keep on doing so today? And that the atomic hypothesis is false? Obviously, this is not what Kuhn thinks, but at the very least it is fair to say that he has expressed himself in an ambiguous way.<a href="note.html#chapter4-87" id="cha-87"><span class="epub-sup">87</span></a> It is likely that the measurements of chemical compositions available in the nineteenth century were rather imprecise, and it is possible that the experimenters were so strongly influenced by the atomic theory that they considered it better confirmed than it actually was. Nevertheless, we have <span class="epub-i">today</span> so much evidence in favor of atomism (much of which is independent of chemistry) that it has become irrational to doubt it.</p>
<p class="tx">Of course, historians have the perfect right to say that this is not what interests them: their aim is to understand what happened when the change of paradigm occurred.<a href="note.html#chapter4-88" id="cha-88"><span class="epub-sup">88</span></a> And it is interesting to see to what extent that change was based on solid empirical arguments or on extra-scientific beliefs such as sun worship. In an extreme case, a correct change of paradigm may even have occurred, by fortunate accident, for completely irrational reasons. This would in no way alter the fact that the theory originally adopted for faulty reasons is <span class="epub-i">today</span> empirically established beyond any reasonable doubt. Furthermore, changes of paradigm, at least in most cases since the birth of modern science, have not occurred for <span class="epub-i">completely</span> irrational reasons. The writings of Galileo or Harvey, for instance, contain many empirical arguments and they are by no means all wrong. There is always, to be sure, a complex mixture of good and bad reasons that lead to the emergence of a new theory, and scientists’ adherence to the new paradigm may very well have taken place before the empirical evidence became totally convincing. This is not at all surprising: scientists must try to guess, as best they can, which paths to follow—life is, after all, short—and provisional decisions must often be taken in the absence of sufficient empirical evidence. This does not undermine the rationality of the scientific enterprise, but it does contribute to making the history of science so fascinating.</p>
<p class="txs">The basic problem is that there are, as the philosopher of science Tim Maudlin has eloquently pointed out, <span class="epub-i">two</span> Kuhns—a moderate Kuhn and his immoderate brother—jostling elbows throughout the pages of <span class="epub-i">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.</span> The moderate Kuhn admits that the scientific debates of the past were settled correctly, but emphasizes that the evidence available at the time was weaker than is generally thought and that non-scientific considerations played a role. We have no objection of principle to the moderate Kuhn, and we leave to historians the task of investigating the extent to which these ideas are correct in concrete situations.<a href="note.html#chapter4-89" id="cha-89"><span class="epub-sup">89</span></a> By contrast, the immoderate Kuhn—who became, perhaps involuntarily, one of the founding fathers of contemporary relativism—thinks that changes of paradigm are due principally to non-empirical factors and that, once accepted, they condition our perception of the world to such an extent that they can <span class="epub-i">only</span> be confirmed by our subsequent experiences. Maudlin eloquently refutes this idea:</p>
<p class="ex">If presented with a moon rock, Aristotle would experience it as a rock, and as an object with a tendency to fall. He could not fail to conclude that the material of which the moon is made is not fundamentally different from terrestrial material with respect to its natural motion.<a href="note.html#chapter4-90" id="cha-90"><span class="epub-sup">90</span></a> Similarly, ever better telescopes revealed more clearly the phases of Venus, irrespective of one’s preferred cosmology<a href="note.html#chapter4-91" id="cha-91"><span class="epub-sup">91</span></a>, and even Ptolemy would have remarked the apparent rotation of a Foucault pendulum.<a href="note.html#chapter4-92" id="cha-92"><span class="epub-sup">92</span></a> The sense in which one’s paradigm may influence one’s experience of the world cannot be so strong as to guarantee that one’s experience will always accord with one’s theories, else the need to revise theories would never arise. (Maudlin 1996, p. 442<a href="note.html#chapter4-93" id="cha-93"><span class="epub-sup">93</span></a>)</p>
<p class="stni">Thus, while it is true that scientific experiments do not provide their own interpretation, it is also true that the theory does not determine the perception of the results.</p>
<p class="tx">The second objection against the radical version of Kuhn’s history of science—an objection we shall also use later against the “strong programme” in the sociology of science—is that of self-refutation. Research in history, and in particular in the history of science, employs methods that are not radically different from those used in the natural sciences: studying documents, drawing the most rational inferences, making inductions based on the available data, and so forth. If arguments of this type in physics or biology did not allow us to arrive at reasonably reliable conclusions, what reason would there be to trust them in history? Why speak in a realist mode about historical categories, such as paradigms, if it is an illusion to speak in a realist mode about scientific concepts (which are in fact much more precisely defined) such as electrons or DNA?<a href="note.html#chapter4-94" id="cha-94"><span class="epub-sup">94</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">But one may go further. It is natural to introduce a hierarchy in the degree of credence accorded to different theories, depending on the quantity and quality of the evidence supporting them.<a href="note.html#chapter4-95" id="cha-95"><span class="epub-sup">95</span></a> Every scientist—indeed, every human being—proceeds in this way and grants a higher subjective probability to the best-established theories (for instance, the evolution of species or the existence of atoms) and a lower subjective probability to more speculative theories (such as detailed theories of quantum gravity). The same reasoning applies when comparing theories in natural science with those in history or sociology. For example, the evidence of the Earth’s rotation is vastly stronger than anything Kuhn could put forward in support of his historical theories. This does not mean, of course, that physicists are more clever than historians or that they use better methods, but simply that they deal with less complex problems, involving a smaller number of variables which, moreover, are easier to measure and to control. It is impossible to avoid introducing such a hierarchy in our beliefs, and this hierarchy implies that there is no conceivable argument based on the Kuhnian view of history that could give succor to those sociologists or philosophers who wish to challenge, in a blanket way, the reliability of scientific results.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Feyerabend: “Anything Goes”</span></p>
<p class="tni">Another famous philosopher who is often quoted in discussions about relativism is Paul Feyerabend. Let us begin by acknowledging that Feyerabend is a complicated character. His personal and political attitudes have earned him a fair amount of sympathy, and his criticisms of attempts at codifying scientific practice are often justified. Moreover, despite the title of one of his books, <span class="epub-i">Farewell to Reason,</span> he never became entirely and openly irrationalist; towards the end of his life he started to distance himself (or so it seems) from the relativist and antiscientific attitudes of some of his followers.<a href="note.html#chapter4-96" id="cha-96"><span class="epub-sup">96</span></a> Nevertheless, Feyerabend’s writings contain numerous ambiguous or confused statements, which sometimes end in violent attacks against modern science: attacks which are simultaneously philosophical, historical, and political, and in which judgments of fact are mixed with judgments of value.<a href="note.html#chapter4-97" id="cha-97"><span class="epub-sup">97</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">The main problem in reading Feyerabend is to know when to take him seriously. On the one hand, he is often considered as a sort of court jester in the philosophy of science, and he seems to have taken some pleasure in playing this role.<a href="note.html#chapter4-98" id="cha-98"><span class="epub-sup">98</span></a> At times he himself emphasized that his words ought not be taken literally.<a href="note.html#chapter4-99" id="cha-99"><span class="epub-sup">99</span></a> On the other hand, his writings are full of references to specialized works in the history and philosophy of science, as well as in physics; and this aspect of his work has greatly contributed to his reputation as a major philosopher of science. Bearing all this in mind, we shall discuss what seem to us to be his fundamental errors, and illustrate the excesses to which they can lead.</p>
<p class="txs">We fundamentally agree with what Feyerabend says about the scientific method, considered in the abstract:</p>
<p class="ex">The idea that science can, and should, be run according to fixed and universal rules, is both unrealistic and pernicious. (Feyerabend 1975, p. 295)</p>
<p class="stnis">He criticizes at length the “fixed and universal rules” through which earlier philosophers thought that they could express the essence of the scientific method. As we have said, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to codify the scientific method, though this does not prevent the development of certain rules, with a more-or-less general degree of validity, on the basis of previous experience. If Feyerabend had limited himself to showing, through historical examples, the limitations of any general and universal codification of the scientific method, we could only agree with him.<a href="note.html#chapter4-100" id="cha-100"><span class="epub-sup">100</span></a> Unfortunately, he goes much farther:</p>
<p class="ex">All methodologies have their limitations and the only ‘rule’ that survives is ‘anything goes’. (Feyerabend 1975, p. 296)</p>
<p class="stni">This is an erroneous inference that is typical of relativist reasoning. Starting from a correct observation—“all methodologies have their limitations”—Feyerabend jumps to a totally false conclusion: “anything goes”. There are several ways to swim, and all of them have their limitations, but it is not true that all bodily movements are equally good (if one prefers not to sink). There is no unique method of criminal investigation, but this does not mean that all methods are equally reliable (think about trial by fire). The same is true of scientific methods.</p>
<p class="txs">In the second edition of his book, Feyerabend tries to defend himself against a literal reading of “anything goes”. He writes:</p>
<p class="ex">A naive anarchist says (a) that both absolute rules and context-dependent rules have their limits and infers (b) that all rules and standards are worthless and should be given up. Most reviewers regard me as a naive anarchist in this sense … [But] while I agree with (a) I do not agree with (b). I argue that all rules have their limits and that there is no comprehensive ‘rationality’, I do not argue that we should proceed without rules and standards. (Feyerabend 1993, p. 231)</p>
<p class="stni">The problem is that Feyerabend gives little indication of the <span class="epub-i">content</span> of these “rules and standards”; and unless they are constrained by some notion of rationality, one arrives easily at the most extreme form of relativism.</p>
<p class="txs">When Feyerabend addresses concrete issues, he frequently mixes reasonable observations with rather bizarre suggestions:</p>
<p class="ex">[T]he first step in our criticism of customary concepts and customary reactions is to step outside the circle and either to invent a new conceptual system, for example a new theory, that clashes with the most carefully established observational results and confounds the most plausible theoretical principles, or to import such a system from outside science, from religion, from mythology, from the ideas of incompetents, or the ramblings of madmen. (Feyerabend 1993, pp. 52–53)<a href="note.html#chapter4-101" id="cha-101"><span class="epub-sup">101</span></a></p>
<p class="stni">One could defend these assertions by invoking the classical distinction between the context of <span class="epub-i">discovery</span> and the context of <span class="epub-i">justification.</span> Indeed, in the idiosyncratic process of inventing scientific theories, all methods are in principle admissible—deduction, induction, analogy, intuition and even hallucination<a href="note.html#chapter4-102" id="cha-102"><span class="epub-sup">102</span></a>—and the only real criterion is pragmatic. On the other hand, the justification of theories must be rational, even if this rationality cannot be definitively codified. One might be tempted to think that Feyerabend’s admittedly extreme examples concern solely the context of discovery, and that there is thus no real contradiction between his viewpoint and ours.</p>
<p class="tx">But the problem is that Feyerabend explicitly <span class="epub-i">denies</span> the validity of the distinction between discovery and justification.<a href="note.html#chapter4-103" id="cha-103"><span class="epub-sup">103</span></a> Of course, the sharpness of this distinction was greatly exaggerated in traditional epistemology. We always come back to the same problem: it is naive to believe that there exist general, context-independent rules that allow us to verify or falsify a theory; otherwise put, the context of justification and the context of discovery evolve historically in parallel.<a href="note.html#chapter4-104" id="cha-104"><span class="epub-sup">104</span></a> Nevertheless, at each moment of history, such a distinction exists. If it didn’t, the justification of theories would be unconstrained by any considerations of rationality. Let us think again about criminal investigations: the culprit can be discovered thanks to all sorts of fortuitous events, but the evidence put forward to prove his guilt does not enjoy such a freedom (even if the standards of evidence also evolve historically).<a href="note.html#chapter4-105" id="cha-105"><span class="epub-sup">105</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">Once Feyerabend has made the leap to “anything goes”, it is not surprising that he constantly compares science with mythology or religion, as, for example, in the following passage:</p>
<p class="ex">Newton reigned for more than 150 years, Einstein briefly introduced a more liberal point of view only to be succeeded by the Copenhagen Interpretation. The similarities between science and myth are indeed astonishing. (Feyerabend 1975, p. 298)</p>
<p class="stni">Here Feyerabend is suggesting that the so-called Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, due principally to Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, was accepted by physicists in a rather dogmatic way, which is not entirely false. (It is less clear which point of view of Einstein he is alluding to.) But what Feyerabend does not give are examples of myths that change because experiments contradict them, or that suggest experiments aimed at discriminating between earlier and later versions of the myth. It is only for this reason—which is crucial—that the “similarities between science and myth” are superficial.</p>
<p class="txs">This analogy occurs again when Feyerabend suggests separating Science and the State:</p>
<p class="exi">While the parents of a six-year-old child can decide to have him instructed in the rudiments of Protestantism, or in the rudiments of the Jewish faith, or to omit religious instruction altogether, they do not have a similar freedom in the case of the sciences. Physics, astronomy, history <span class="epub-i">must</span> be learned. They cannot be replaced by magic, astrology, or by a study of legends.</p>
<p class="exi">Nor is one content with a merely <span class="epub-i">historical</span> presentation of physical (astronomical, historical, etc.) facts and principles. One does not say: <span class="epub-i">some people believe</span> that the earth moves round the sun while others regard the earth as a hollow sphere that contains the sun, the planets, the fixed stars. One says: the earth <span class="epub-i">moves</span> round the sun—everything else is sheer idiocy. (Feyerabend 1975, p. 301)</p>
<p class="stni">In this passage Feyerabend reintroduces, in a particularly brutal form, the classical distinction between “facts” and “theories”—a basic tenet of the Vienna Circle epistemology he rejects. At the same time he appears to use implicitly in the social sciences a naively realist epistemology that he rejects for the natural sciences. How, after all, does one find out exactly what “some people believe”, if not by using methods analogous to those of the sciences (observations, polls, etc.)? If, in a survey of Americans’ astronomical beliefs, the sample were limited to physics professors, there would probably be no one who “regards the earth as a hollow sphere”; but Feyerabend could respond, quite rightly, that the poll was poorly designed and the sampling biased (would he dare say that it is unscientific?). The same goes for an anthropologist who stays in New York and invents in his office the myths of other peoples. But which criteria acceptable to Feyerabend would be violated? Doesn’t anything go? Feyerabend’s methodological relativism, if taken literally, is so radical that it becomes self-refuting. Without a minimum of (rational) method, even a “merely historical presentation of facts” becomes impossible.</p>
<p class="tx">What is striking in Feyerabend’s writings is, paradoxically, their abstractness and generality. His arguments show, at best, that science does not progress by following a well-defined method, and with that we basically agree. But Feyerabend never explains in what sense atomic theory or evolution theory might be <span class="epub-i">false,</span> despite all that we know today. And if he does not say that, it is probably because he does not believe it, and shares (at least in part) with most of his colleagues the scientific view of the world, namely that species evolved, that matter is made of atoms, etc. And if he shares those ideas, it is probably because he has good reasons to do so. Why not think about those reasons and try to make them explicit, rather than just repeating over and over again that they are not justifiable by some universal rules of method? Working case by case, he could show that there are indeed solid empirical arguments supporting those theories.</p>
<p class="tx">Of course, this may or may not be the kind of question that interests Feyerabend. He often gives the impression that his opposition to science is not of a cognitive nature but follows rather from a choice of lifestyle, as when he says: “love becomes impossible for people who insist on ‘objectivity’, i.e. who live entirely in accordance with the spirit of science.”<a href="note.html#chapter4-106" id="cha-106"><span class="epub-sup">106</span></a> The trouble is that he fails to make a clear distinction between factual judgments and value judgments. He could, for example, maintain that evolution theory is infinitely more plausible than any creationist myth, but that parents nevertheless have a right to demand that schools teach false theories to their children. We would disagree, but the debate would no longer be purely on the cognitive level, and would involve political and ethical considerations.</p>
<p class="txs">In the same vein, Feyerabend writes in the introduction to the Chinese edition of <span class="epub-i">Against Method</span><a href="note.html#chapter4-107" id="cha-107"><span class="epub-sup">107</span></a>:</p>
<p class="ex"><span class="epub-i">First-world science is one science among many …</span> My main motive in writing the book was humanitarian, not intellectual. I wanted to support people, not to ‘advance knowledge’. (Feyerabend 1988, p. 3 and 1993, p. 3, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">The problem is that the first thesis is of a purely cognitive nature (at least if he is speaking of science and not of technology), while the second is linked to practical goals. But if, in reality, there are no “other sciences” really distinct from those of the “first world” that are nevertheless equally powerful at the cognitive level, in what way would asserting the first thesis (which would be false) allow him to “support people”? The problems of truth and objectivity cannot be evaded so easily.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">The “Strong Programme” in the Sociology of Science</span></p>
<p class="tni">During the 1970s, a new school in the sociology of science arose. While previous sociologists of science were, in general, content to analyze the social context in which scientific activity takes place, the researchers gathered under the banner of the “strong programme” were, as the name indicates, considerably more ambitious. Their aim was to explain in sociological terms the <span class="epub-i">content</span> of scientific theories.</p>
<p class="tx">Of course, most scientists, when they hear about these ideas, protest and point out the substantial missing piece in this kind of explanation: Nature itself.<a href="note.html#chapter4-108" id="cha-108"><span class="epub-sup">108</span></a> In this section we shall explain the fundamental conceptual problems faced by the strong programme. While some of its supporters have recently made corrections to their initial claims, they do not seem to realize the extent to which their starting point was erroneous.</p>
<p class="txs">Let us start by quoting the principles set forth for the sociology of knowledge by one of the founders of the strong programme, David Bloor:</p>
<p class="nls">1. It would be causal, that is, concerned with the conditions which bring about belief or states of knowledge. Naturally there will be other types of causes apart from social ones which will cooperate in bringing about belief.</p>
<p class="nls">2. It would be impartial with respect to truth and falsity, rationality or irrationality, success or failure. Both sides of these dichotomies will require explanation.</p>
<p class="nls">3. It would be symmetrical in its style of explanation. The same types of cause would explain, say, true and false beliefs.</p>
<p class="nl">4. It would be reflexive. In principle its patterns of explanation would have to be applicable to sociology itself. (Bloor 1991, p. 7)</p>
<p class="stxs">To grasp what is meant by “causal”, “impartial” and “symmetrical”, we shall analyze an article of Bloor and his colleague Barry Barnes in which they explain and defend their programme.<a href="note.html#chapter4-109" id="cha-109"><span class="epub-sup">109</span></a> The article begins with an apparent statement of good will:</p>
<p class="ex">Far from being a threat to the scientific understanding of forms of knowledge, relativism is required by it.… It is those who oppose relativism, and who grant certain forms of knowledge a privileged status, who pose the real threat to a scientific understanding of knowledge and cognition. (Barnes and Bloor 1981, pp. 21–22)</p>
<p class="stnis">However, this already raises the issue of self-refutation: Doesn’t the discourse of the sociologist, who wants to provide “a scientific understanding of knowledge and cognition”, claim “a privileged status” with respect to other discourses, for example those of the “rationalists” that Barnes and Bloor criticize in the rest of their article? It seems to us that, if one seeks to have a “scientific” understanding of anything, one is forced to make a distinction between a good and a bad understanding. Barnes and Bloor seem to be aware of this, since they write:</p>
<p class="ex">The relativist, like everyone else, is under the necessity to sort out beliefs, accepting some and rejecting others. He will naturally have preferences and these will typically coincide with those of others in his locality. The words ‘true’ and ‘false’ provide the idiom in which those evaluations are expressed, and the words ‘rational’ and ‘irrational’ will have a similar function. (Barnes and Bloor 1981, p. 27)</p>
<p class="stni">But this is a strange notion of “truth”, which manifestly contradicts the notion used in everyday life.<a href="note.html#chapter4-110" id="cha-110"><span class="epub-sup">110</span></a> If I regard the statement “I drank coffee this morning” as true, I do not mean simply that I <span class="epub-i">prefer</span> to believe that I drank coffee this morning, much less that “others in my locality” think that I drank coffee this morning!<a href="note.html#chapter4-111" id="cha-111"><span class="epub-sup">111</span></a> What we have here is a radical redefinition of the concept of truth, which nobody (starting with Barnes and Bloor themselves) would accept in practice for ordinary knowledge. Why, then, should it be accepted for scientific knowledge? Note also that, even in the latter context, this definition doesn’t hold water: Galileo, Darwin, and Einstein did not sort out their beliefs by following those of others in their locality.</p>
<p class="tx">Moreover, Barnes and Bloor fail to use systematically their new notion of “truth”; from time to time they fall back, without comment, on the traditional sense of the word. For example, at the beginning of their article, they admit that “to say that all beliefs are equally true encounters the problem of how to handle beliefs which contradict one another”, and that “to say that all beliefs are equally false poses the problem of the status of the relativist’s own claims.”<a href="note.html#chapter4-112" id="cha-112"><span class="epub-sup">112</span></a> But if “a true belief” meant only “a belief that one shares with other people in one’s locality”, the problem of the contradiction between beliefs held in different places would no longer pose any problem.<a href="note.html#chapter4-113" id="cha-113"><span class="epub-sup">113</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">A similar ambiguity plagues their discussion of rationality:</p>
<p class="ex">For the relativist there is no sense attached to the idea that some standards or beliefs are really rational as distinct from merely locally accepted as such. (Barnes and Bloor 1981, p. 27)</p>
<p class="stni">Again, what exactly does this mean? Isn’t it “really rational” to believe that the Earth is (approximately) round, at least for those of us who have access to airplanes and satellite photos? Is this merely a “locally accepted” belief?</p>
<p class="tx">Barnes and Bloor seem here to be playing on two levels: a general skepticism, which of course cannot be refuted; and a concrete program aiming at a “scientific” sociology of knowledge. But the latter presupposes that one has given up radical skepticism and that one is trying, as best one can, to understand some part of reality.</p>
<p class="txs">Let us therefore temporarily put aside the arguments in favor of radical skepticism, and ask whether the “strong programme”, considered as a scientific project, is plausible. Here is how Barnes and Bloor explain the symmetry principle on which the strong programme is based:</p>
<p class="ex">Our equivalence postulate is that all beliefs are on a par with one another with respect to the causes of their credibility. It is not that all beliefs are equally true or equally false, but that regardless of truth and falsity the fact of their credibility is to be seen as equally problematic. The position we shall defend is that the incidence of all beliefs without exception calls for empirical investigation and must be accounted for by finding the specific, local causes of this credibility. This means that regardless of whether the sociologist evaluates a belief as true or rational, or as false and irrational, he must search for the causes of its credibility.… All these questions can, and should, be answered without regard to the status of the belief as it is judged and evaluated by the sociologist’s own standards. (Barnes and Bloor 1981, p. 23)</p>
<p class="stni">Here, instead of a <span class="epub-i">general</span> skepticism or philosophical relativism, Barnes and Bloor are clearly proposing a <span class="epub-i">methodological</span> relativism for sociologists of knowledge. But the ambiguity remains: what exactly do they mean by “without regard to the status of the belief as it is judged and evaluated by the sociologist’s own standards”?</p>
<p class="tx">If the claim were merely that we should use the same principles of sociology and psychology to explain the causation of all beliefs irrespective of whether we evaluate them as true or false, rational or irrational, then we would have no particular objection.<a href="note.html#chapter4-114" id="cha-114"><span class="epub-sup">114</span></a> But if the claim is that only <span class="epub-i">social</span> causes can enter into such an explanation—that the way the world <span class="epub-i">is</span> (i.e., Nature) cannot enter—then we cannot disagree more strenuously.<a href="note.html#chapter4-115" id="cha-115"><span class="epub-sup">115</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">In order to understand the role of Nature, let us consider a concrete example: Why did the European scientific community become convinced of the truth of Newtonian mechanics sometime between 1700 and 1750? Undoubtedly a variety of historical, sociological, ideological, and political factors must play a part in this explanation—one must explain, for example, why Newtonian mechanics was accepted quickly in England but more slowly in France<a href="note.html#chapter4-116" id="cha-116"><span class="epub-sup">116</span></a>—but certainly <span class="epub-i">some</span> part of the explanation (and a rather important part at that) must be that the planets and comets really do move (to a very high degree of approximation, though not exactly) as predicted by Newtonian mechanics.<a href="note.html#chapter4-117" id="cha-117"><span class="epub-sup">117</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Here’s a more homely example: Suppose we encounter a man running out of a lecture hall screaming at the top of his lungs that there’s a stampeding herd of elephants inside. What we are to make of this assertion, and in particular how we are to evaluate its “causes”, should, it seems clear, depend heavily on whether or not there <span class="epub-i">is</span> in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in the room—or, more precisely, since admittedly we have no direct, unmediated access to external reality—whether when we and other people peek (cautiously!) into the room <span class="epub-i">we</span> see or hear a stampeding herd of elephants (or the destruction that such a herd might recently have caused before exiting the room). If we do see such evidence of elephants, then the most plausible explanation for the entire set of observations is that there <span class="epub-i">is</span> (or was) in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in the lecture hall, that the man saw and/or heard it, and that his subsequent fright (which we might well share under the circumstances) led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion we overheard. And our reaction would be to call the police and the zookeepers. If, on the other hand, our own observations reveal no evidence of elephants in the lecture hall, then the most plausible explanation is that there was <span class="epub-i">not</span> in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in the room, that the man <span class="epub-i">imagined</span> the elephants as a result of some psychosis (whether internally or chemically induced), and that <span class="epub-i">this</span> led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion we overheard. And we’d call the police and the psychiatrists.<a href="note.html#chapter4-118" id="cha-118"><span class="epub-sup">118</span></a> And we daresay that Barnes and Bloor, whatever they might write in journal articles for sociologists and philosophers, would do the same in real life.</p>
<p class="tx">Now, as we explained before, we do not see any <span class="epub-i">fundamental</span> difference between the epistemology of science and the rational attitude in everyday life: the former is nothing but the extension and refinement of the latter. Any philosophy of science—or methodology for sociologists—that is so blatantly wrong when applied to the epistemology of everyday life must be severely flawed at its core.</p>
<p class="tx">In summary, it seems to us that the “strong programme” is ambiguous in its intent; and, depending on how one resolves the ambiguity, it becomes either a valid and mildly interesting corrective to the most naive psychological and sociological notions—reminding us that “true beliefs have causes too”—or else a gross and blatant error.</p>
<p class="tx">The supporters of the “strong programme” thus face a dilemma. They could, if they choose, adhere systematically to a philosophical skepticism or relativism; but in that case it is unclear why (or how) they would seek to build a “scientific” sociology. Alternatively, they could choose to adopt only a methodological relativism; but this position is untenable if one abandons philosophical relativism, because it ignores an essential element of the desired explanation, namely Nature itself. For this reason, the sociological approach of the “strong programme” and the relativistic philosophical attitude are mutually reinforcing. Therein resides the danger (and no doubt the appeal for some) of the different variants of this programme.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Bruno Latour and His Rules of Method</span></p>
<p class="tni">The strong programme in the sociology of science has found an echo in France, particularly around Bruno Latour. His works contain a great number of propositions formulated so ambiguously that they can hardly be taken literally. And when one removes the ambiguity—as we shall do here in a few examples—one reaches the conclusion that the assertion is either true but banal, or else surprising but manifestly false.</p>
<p class="txs">In his theoretical work, <span class="epub-i">Science in Action</span><a href="note.html#chapter4-119" id="cha-119"><span class="epub-sup">119</span></a>, Latour develops seven Rules of Method for the sociologist of science. Here is the Third Rule of Method:</p>
<p class="ex">Since the settlement of a controversy is the <span class="epub-i">cause</span> of Nature’s representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome—Nature—to explain how and why a controversy has been settled. (Latour 1987, pp. 99, 258)</p>
<p class="stni">Note how Latour slips, without comment or argument, from “Nature’s representation” in the first half of this sentence to “Nature” <span class="epub-i">tout court</span> in the second half. If we were to read “Nature’s representation” in <span class="epub-i">both</span> halves, then we’d have the truism that scientists’ <span class="epub-i">representations</span> of Nature (that is, their theories) are arrived at by a social process, and that the course and outcome of that social process can’t be explained simply by its outcome. If, on the other hand, we take “Nature” seriously in the second half, linked as it is to the word “outcome”, then we would have the claim that the external world is <span class="epub-i">created</span> by scientists’ negotiations: a claim that is, to say the least, a rather bizarre form of radical idealism. Finally, if we take “Nature” seriously in the second half but expunge the word “outcome” preceding it, then we would have either (a) the weak (and trivially true) claim that the course and outcome of a scientific controversy cannot be explained <span class="epub-i">solely</span> by the nature of the external world (obviously <span class="epub-i">some</span> social factors play a role, if only in determining which experiments are technologically feasible at a given time, not to mention other, more subtle social influences); or (b) the strong (and manifestly false) claim that the nature of the external world plays <span class="epub-i">no</span> role in constraining the course and outcome of a scientific controversy.<a href="note.html#chapter4-120" id="cha-120"><span class="epub-sup">120</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">We could be accused here of focusing our attention on an ambiguity of formulation and of not trying to understand what Latour really means. In order to counter this objection, let us go back to the section “Appealing (to) Nature” (pp. 94–100) where the Third Rule is introduced and developed. Latour begins by ridiculing the appeal to Nature as a way of resolving scientific controversies, such as the one concerning solar neutrinos<a href="note.html#chapter4-121" id="cha-121"><span class="epub-sup">121</span></a>:</p>
<p class="ex">A fierce controversy divides the astrophysicists who calculate the number of neutrinos coming out of the sun and Davis, the experimentalist who obtains a much smaller figure. It is easy to distinguish them and put the controversy to rest. Just let us see for ourselves in which camp the sun is really to be found. Somewhere the natural sun with its true number of neutrinos will close the mouths of dissenters and force them to accept the facts no matter how well written these papers were. (Latour 1987, p. 95)</p>
<p class="stni">Why does Latour choose to be ironic? The problem is to know how many neutrinos are emitted by the Sun, and this question is indeed difficult. We can hope that it will be resolved some day, not because “the natural sun will close the mouths of dissenters”, but because sufficiently powerful empirical data will become available. Indeed, in order to fill in the gaps in the currently available data and to discriminate between the currently existing theories, several groups of physicists have recently built detectors of different types, and they are now performing the (difficult) measurements.<a href="note.html#chapter4-122" id="cha-122"><span class="epub-sup">122</span></a> It is thus reasonable to expect that the controversy will be settled sometime in the next few years, thanks to an accumulation of evidence that, taken together, will indicate clearly the correct solution. However, other scenarios are in principle possible: the controversy could die out because people stop being interested in the issue, or because the problem turns out to be too difficult to solve; and, at this level, sociological factors undoubtedly play a role (if only because of the budgetary constraints on research). Obviously, scientists think, or at least hope, that if the controversy is resolved it will be because of observations and not because of the literary qualities of the scientific papers. Otherwise, they will simply have ceased to do science.</p>
<p class="txs">But we, like Latour, do not work professionally on the solar-neutrino problem; we are unable to render an informed guess as to how many neutrinos the Sun emits. We could try to get a rough idea by examining the scientific literature on the subject; or failing that, we could get an even rougher idea by examining the sociological aspects of the problem, for example, the scientific respectability of the researchers involved in the controversy. And there is no doubt that, in practice, this is what scientists themselves do when they don’t work in the field, for lack of a better alternative. But the degree of certainty provided by this kind of investigation is very weak. Nevertheless, Latour seems to accord it a crucial role. He distinguishes between two “versions”: according to the first, it is Nature that decides the outcome of controversies; according to the second, the power struggles between researchers play that role.</p>
<p class="exi">It is crucial for us, laypeople who want to understand technoscience, to decide which version is right, because in the first version, as Nature is enough to settle all disputes, we have nothing to do since no matter how large the resources of the scientists are, they do not matter in the end—only Nature matters.… In the second version, however, we have a lot of work to do since, by analysing the allies and resources that settle a controversy we understand <span class="epub-i">everything</span> that there is to understand in technoscience. If the first version is correct, there is nothing for us to do apart from catching the most superficial aspects of science; if the second version is maintained, there is everything to understand except perhaps the most superfluous and flashy aspects of science. Given the stakes, the reader will realise why this problem should be tackled with caution. The whole book is in jeopardy here. (Latour 1987, p. 97, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stxs">Since “the whole book is in jeopardy here”, let us look carefully at this passage. Latour says that if it is Nature that settles the controversies, the role of the sociologist is secondary, but if that is not the case, the sociologist can understand “<span class="epub-i">everything</span> that there is to understand in technoscience”. How does he decide which version is the correct one? The answer appears in the subsequent text, where Latour distinguishes between the “cold parts of technoscience”, for which “Nature is now taken as the cause of accurate descriptions of herself” (p. 100), and the active controversies, where Nature cannot be invoked:</p>
<p class="ex">When studying controversy—as we have so far—we cannot be <span class="epub-i">less</span> relativist than the very scientists and engineers we accompany; they do not <span class="epub-i">use</span> Nature as the external referee, and we have no reason to imagine that we are more clever than they are. (Latour 1987, p. 99, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stx">In this quote and the previous one, Latour is playing constantly on the confusion between facts and our knowledge of them.<a href="note.html#chapter4-123" id="cha-123"><span class="epub-sup">123</span></a> The correct answer to any scientific question, solved or not, depends on the state of Nature (for example, on the number of neutrinos that the Sun really emits). Now, it happens that, for the unsolved problems, nobody knows the right answer, while for the solved ones, we do know it (at least if the accepted solution is correct, which can always be challenged). But there is no reason to adopt a “relativist” attitude in one case and a “realist” one in the other. The difference between these attitudes is a philosophical matter, and is independent of whether the problem is solved or not. For the relativist, there is simply no unique correct answer, independent of all social and cultural circumstances; this holds for the closed questions as well as for the open ones. On the other hand, the scientists who seek the correct solution are not relativist, almost by definition. Of course they <span class="epub-i">do</span> “use Nature as the external referee”: that is, they seek to know what is really happening in Nature, and they design experiments for that purpose.</p>
<p class="tx">Let us not, however, leave the impression that the Third Rule of Method is <span class="epub-i">only</span> a triviality or a gross error. We’d like to give it one more interpretation (which is undoubtedly <span class="epub-i">not</span> La-tour’s own) that makes it at the same time interesting and correct. Let us read it as a methodological principle for a sociologist of science who does not himself have the scientific competence to make an independent assessment of whether the experimental/observational data do in fact warrant the conclusions the scientific community has drawn from them.<a href="note.html#chapter4-124" id="cha-124"><span class="epub-sup">124</span></a> In such a situation, the sociologist will be understandably reluctant to say that “the scientific community under study came to conclusion X because X is the way the world really is”—<span class="epub-i">even if it is in fact the case</span> that X is the way the world is and that is the reason the scientists came to believe it—because the sociologist has no independent <span class="epub-i">grounds to believe</span> that X is the way the world really is other than the fact that the scientific community under study came to believe it. Of course, the sensible conclusion to draw from this <span class="epub-i">cul de sac</span> is that sociologists of science ought not to study scientific controversies on which they lack the competence to make an independent assessment of the facts, if there is no other (for example, historically later) scientific community on which they could justifiably rely for such an independent assessment. But it goes without saying that Latour would not enjoy this conclusion.<a href="note.html#chapter4-125" id="cha-125"><span class="epub-sup">125</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">Here lies, in fact, the fundamental problem for the sociologist of “science in action”. It is not enough to study the alliances or power relationships between scientists, important though they may be. What appears to a sociologist as a pure power game may in fact be motivated by perfectly rational considerations which, however, can be understood as such only through a detailed understanding of the scientific theories and experiments.</p>
<p class="tx">Of course, nothing prevents a sociologist from acquiring such an understanding—or from working in collaboration with scientists who already have it—but in none of his Rules of Method does Latour recommend that sociologists of science follow this route. Indeed, in the case of Einstein’s relativity, we can show that Latour did not follow it himself.<a href="note.html#chapter4-126" id="cha-126"><span class="epub-sup">126</span></a> This is understandable, because it is difficult to acquire the requisite knowledge, even for scientists working in a slightly different field. But nothing is gained by biting off more than one can chew.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Practical Consequences</span></p>
<p class="tnis">We don’t want to give the impression that we are attacking only some esoteric philosophical doctrines or the methodology followed by one current in the sociology of science. In fact, our target is much wider. Relativism (as well as other postmodern ideas) has effects on the culture in general and on people’s ways of thinking. Here are a few examples we have come across. We have no doubt that the reader will find many other examples in the culture sections of newspapers, in certain educational theories, or simply in day-to-day conversations.</p>
<p class="tnis"><span class="epub-b">1. Relativism and criminal investigations.</span> We have applied various relativist arguments to criminal investigations in order to show that, since they are thoroughly unconvincing in that context, there is little reason to give them credence when applied to science. That is why the following excerpt is surprising, to say the least: taken literally, it expresses a rather strong form of relativism concerning precisely a criminal investigation. Here is the context: In 1996, Belgium was shaken by a series of kidnap-murders of children. In response to public outrage at the inept police work, a parliamentary commission was set up to examine the errors committed during the investigation. In a spectacular televised session, two witnesses—a policeman (Lesage) and a judge (Doutrèwe)—were confronted and questioned concerning the transmission of a key file. The policeman swore he had sent the file to the judge, while the judge denied having received it. The next day, an anthropologist of communication, Professor Yves Winkin of the University of Liège, was interviewed by one of the main Belgian newspapers <span class="epub-i">(Le Soir</span> of 20 December 1996):</p>
<p class="ex"><span class="epub-b">Question:</span> The confrontation [between Lesage and Doutrèwe] was stimulated by an almost ultimate search for truth. Does truth exist?</p>
<p class="ex"><span class="epub-b">Answer:</span> … I think that all the work of the commission is based on a sort of presupposition that there exists, not <span class="epub-i">a</span> truth, but <span class="epub-i">the</span> truth—which, if one presses hard enough, will finally come out.</p>
<p class="exi">However, anthropologically, there are only partial truths, shared by a larger or smaller number of people: a group, a family, a firm. There is no transcendent truth. Therefore, I don’t think that judge Doutrèwe or officer Lesage are hiding anything: both are telling their truth.</p>
<p class="exi">Truth is always linked to an organization, depending upon the elements that are perceived as important. It is not surprising that these two people, representing two very different professional universes, should each set forth a different truth. Having said that, I think that, in this context of public responsibility, the commission can only proceed as it does.</p>
<p class="stx">This answer illustrates, in a striking way, the confusions into which some sectors of the social sciences have fallen through their use of a relativist vocabulary. The dispute between the policeman and the judge concerns, after all, a material fact: the transmission of a file. (It is, of course, possible that the file was sent but got lost on the way; but this remains a well-defined factual question.) Without a doubt, the epistemological problem is complicated: how is the commission to find out what really happened? Nevertheless, there <span class="epub-i">is</span> a truth of the matter: either the file was sent or it wasn’t. It is hard to see what is gained by redefining the word “truth” (whether or not it is “partial”) to mean simply “a belief shared by a larger or smaller number of people”.</p>
<p class="txs">In this text, one also finds the idea of “different universes”. Little by little, some tendencies in the social sciences have atomized humankind into cultures and groups having their own conceptual universes—sometimes even their own “realities”—and virtually unable to communicate with one another.<a href="note.html#chapter4-127" id="cha-127"><span class="epub-sup">127</span></a> But in this case it reaches a level bordering on the absurd: these two people speak the same language, live less than a hundred miles apart, and work in the criminal-justice system of a French-speaking Belgian community comprising barely four million people. Clearly, the problem does not arise from an inability to communicate: the policeman and the judge understand perfectly well what is being asked, and they most likely know the truth; quite simply, one of them has an interest in lying. But even if they are both telling the truth—i.e., the file was sent but got lost in transit, which is logically possible though unlikely—it makes no sense to say that “both are telling <span class="epub-i">their</span> truth”. Fortunately, when it comes down to practical considerations, the anthropologist admits that the commission “can only proceed as it does”, that is, seek <span class="epub-i">the</span> truth. But what incredible confusions before getting there.</p>
<p class="tnis"><span class="epub-b">2. Relativism and education.</span> In a book written for highschool teachers, whose goal is to explain “some notions of epistemology”<a href="note.html#chapter4-128" id="cha-128"><span class="epub-sup">128</span></a>, one finds the following definition:</p>
<p class="ex"><span class="epub-b">Fact</span></p>
<p class="exi">What one generally calls a fact is an interpretation of a situation that no one, at least for the moment, wants to call into question. It should be remembered that, as the common language says, a fact becomes established, which illustrates well that we’re talking about a theoretical model that one claims is appropriate.</p>
<p class="exi">Example: The assertions “The computer is on the desk” or “If one boils water, it evaporates” are considered to be factual propositions in the sense that no one wants to contest them at this moment in time. They are statements of theoretical interpretations that no one questions.</p>
<p class="exi">To assert that a proposition states a fact (that is, has the status of a factual or empirical proposition) is to claim that there is hardly any controversy about this interpretation at the moment one is speaking. But a fact can be put into question.</p>
<p class="exi">Example: For many centuries, it was considered to be a fact that the Sun revolves each day around the Earth. The appearance of another theory, such as that of the diurnal rotation of the Earth, entailed the replacement of the fact just cited by another: “The Earth rotates on its axis each day.” (Fourez <span class="epub-i">et al.</span> 1997, pp. 76–77)</p>
<p class="stx">This confuses facts with <span class="epub-i">assertions</span> of fact.<a href="note.html#chapter4-129" id="cha-129"><span class="epub-sup">129</span></a> For us, as for most people, a “fact” is a situation in the external world that exists irrespective of the knowledge we have (or don’t have) of it—in particular, irrespective of any consensus or interpretation. Thus, it makes sense to say there are facts of which we are ignorant (Shakespeare’s exact birth date, or the number of neutrinos emitted per second by the Sun). And there is a world of difference between saying that X killed Y and saying that no one, for the moment, wants to dispute this assertion (e.g., because X is black and everyone else is racist, or because biased news media successfully make people think that X killed Y). When it comes to a concrete example, the authors backtrack: they say that the Sun’s revolution around the Earth was <span class="epub-i">considered to be</span> a fact, which amounts to admitting the distinction we are stressing (i.e., it was not <span class="epub-i">really</span> a fact). But in the next sentence they fall back into confusion: one fact has been replaced by another. Taken literally, in the <span class="epub-i">usual</span> sense of the word “fact”, this would mean that the Earth has rotated on its axis only since Copernicus. But, of course, all the authors really mean is that people’s beliefs changed. Then why not say so, rather than confusing facts with (consensus) beliefs by using the same word to denote both concepts?<a href="note.html#chapter4-130" id="cha-130"><span class="epub-sup">130</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">A side benefit of the authors’ non-standard notion of “fact” is that one can never be wrong (at least when asserting the same things as the people around us). A theory is never wrong in the sense that it is contradicted by the facts; rather, the facts change when the theories change.</p>
<p class="txs">Most importantly, it seems to us that a pedagogy based on this notion of “fact” is antithetical to encouraging a critical spirit in the student. In order to challenge prevailing assumptions—other people’s as well as our own—it is essential to keep in mind that one <span class="epub-i">can</span> be wrong: that there exist facts independent of our claims, and that it is by comparison with these facts (to the extent we can ascertain them) that our claims have to be evaluated. When all is said and done, Fourez’s redefinition of “fact” has—as Bertrand Russell noted in a similar context—all the advantages of theft over honest toil.<a href="note.html#chapter4-131" id="cha-131"><span class="epub-sup">131</span></a></p>
<p class="tni"><span class="epub-b">3. Relativism in the Third World.</span> Unfortunately, postmodern ideas are not confined to European philosophy departments or American literature departments. It seems to us that they do the most harm in the Third World, where the majority of the world’s population lives and where the supposedly “passé” work of the Enlightenment is far from complete.</p>
<p class="txs">Meera Nanda, an Indian biochemist who used to work in the “Science for the People” movements in India and who is now studying sociology of science in the United States, tells the following story about the traditional Vedic superstitions governing the construction of sacred buildings, which aim at maximizing “positive energy”. An Indian politician, who found himself in hot water, was advised that</p>
<p class="ex">his troubles would vanish if he entered his office from an east-facing gate. But on the east side of his office there was a slum through which his car could not pass. [So he] ordered the slum to be demolished. (Nanda 1997, p. 82)</p>
<p class="stnis">Nanda observes, quite rightly, that</p>
<p class="exi">If the Indian left were as active in the people’s science movement as it used to be, it would have led an agitation not only against the demolition of people’s homes, but also against the superstition that was used to justify it.… A left movement that was not so busy establishing “respect” for non-Western knowledge would never have allowed the power-wielders to hide behind indigenous “experts.”</p>
<p class="exi">I tried out this case on my social constructionist friends here in the United States.… [They told me] that seeing the two culturally bound descriptions of space<a href="note.html#chapter4-132" id="cha-132"><span class="epub-sup">132</span></a> at par with each other is progressive in itself, for then <span class="epub-i">neither</span> can claim to know the absolute truth, and thus tradition will lose its hold on people’s minds. (Nanda 1997, p. 82)</p>
<p class="stni">The problem with this kind of answer is that practical choices have to be made—what type of medicine to use, or in which direction to orient buildings—and at this point theoretical non-chalance becomes untenable. As a result, intellectuals easily fall into the hypocrisy of using “Western” science when it is essential—for example, when they are <span class="epub-i">seriously</span> ill—while urging the common people to put their faith in superstitions.</p>
