<p class="fmh" id="pre"><span class="epub-b">Preface to the English Edition</span></p>
<p class="tni">The publication in France of our book <span class="epub-i">Impostures Intellectuelles</span><a href="note.html#preface-1" id="pre-1"><span class="epub-sup">1</span></a> appears to have created a small storm in certain intellectual circles. According to Jon Henley in <span class="epub-i">The Guardian,</span> we have shown that “modern French philosophy is a load of old tosh.”<a href="note.html#preface-2" id="pre-2"><span class="epub-sup">2</span></a> According to Robert Maggiori in <span class="epub-i">Libération,</span> we are humorless scientistic pedants who correct grammatical errors in love letters.<a href="note.html#preface-3" id="pre-3"><span class="epub-sup">3</span></a> We would like to explain briefly why neither is the case, and to answer both our critics and our overenthusiastic supporters. In particular, we want to dispel a number of misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="tx">The book grew out of the now-famous hoax in which one of us published, in the American cultural-studies journal <span class="epub-i">Social Text,</span> a parody article crammed with nonsensical, but unfortunately authentic, quotations about physics and mathematics by prominent French and American intellectuals.<a href="note.html#preface-4" id="pre-4"><span class="epub-sup">4</span></a> However, only a small fraction of the “dossier” discovered during Sokal’s library research could be included in the parody. After showing this larger dossier to scientist and non-scientist friends, we became (slowly) convinced that it might be worth making it available to a wider audience. We wanted to explain, in non-technical terms, why the quotes are absurd or, in many cases, simply meaningless; and we wanted also to discuss the cultural circumstances that enabled these discourses to achieve such renown and to remain, thus far, unexposed.</p>
<p class="tx">But what exactly do we claim? Neither too much nor too little. We show that famous intellectuals such as Lacan, Kristeva, Irigaray, Baudrillard, and Deleuze have repeatedly abused scientific concepts and terminology: either using scientific ideas totally out of context, without giving the slightest justification—note that we are not against extrapolating concepts from one field to another, but only against extrapolations made without argument—or throwing around scientific jargon in front of their non-scientist readers without any regard for its relevance or even its meaning. We make no claim that this invalidates the rest of their work, on which we suspend judgment.</p>
<p class="tx">We are sometimes accused of being arrogant scientists, but our view of the hard sciences’ role is in fact rather modest. Wouldn’t it be nice (for us mathematicians and physicists, that is) if Gödel’s theorem or relativity theory <span class="epub-i">did</span> have immediate and deep implications for the study of society? Or if the axiom of choice could be used to study poetry? Or if topology had something to do with the human psyche? But alas, it is not the case.</p>
<p class="tx">A second target of our book is epistemic relativism, namely the idea—which, at least when expressed explicitly, is much more widespread in the English-speaking world than in France—that modern science is nothing more than a “myth”, a “narration” or a “social construction” among many others.<a href="note.html#preface-5" id="pre-5"><span class="epub-sup">5</span></a> Besides some gross abuses (e.g. Irigaray), we dissect a number of confusions that are rather frequent in postmodernist and cultural-studies circles: for example, misappropriating ideas from the philosophy of science, such as the underdetermination of theory by evidence or the theory-ladenness of observation, in order to support radical relativism.</p>
<p class="tx">This book is therefore made up of two distinct—but related—works under one cover. First, there is the collection of extreme abuses discovered, rather haphazardly, by Sokal; this is the “fashionable nonsense” of our title. Second, there is our critique of epistemic relativism and of misconceptions about “postmodern science”; these analyses are considerably more subtle. The connection between these two critiques is primarily sociological: the French authors of the “nonsense” are fashionable in many of the same English-speaking academic circles where epistemic relativism is the coin of the realm.<a href="note.html#preface-6" id="pre-6"><span class="epub-sup">6</span></a> There is also a weak logical link: if one accepts epistemic relativism, there is less reason to be upset by the misrepresentation of scientific ideas, which anyway are just another “discourse”.</p>
<p class="tx">Obviously, we did not write this book just to point out some isolated abuses. We have larger targets in mind, but not necessarily those that are attributed to us. This book deals with mystification, deliberately obscure language, confused thinking, and the misuse of scientific concepts. The texts we quote may be the tip of an iceberg, but the iceberg should be defined as a set of intellectual practices, not a social group.</p>
<p class="tx">Suppose, for example, that a journalist discovers documents showing that several highly respected politicians are corrupt, and publishes them. (We emphasize that this is an analogy and that we do not consider the abuses described here to be of comparable gravity.) Some people will, no doubt, leap to the conclusion that <span class="epub-i">most</span> politicians are corrupt, and demagogues who stand to gain politically from this notion will encourage it.<a href="note.html#preface-7" id="pre-7"><span class="epub-sup">7</span></a> But this extrapolation would be erroneous.</p>
<p class="tx">Similarly, to view this book as a generalized criticism of the humanities or the social sciences—as some French reviewers did—not only misunderstands our intentions, but is a curious assimilation, revealing a contemptuous attitude toward those fields in the minds of those reviewers.<a href="note.html#preface-8" id="pre-8"><span class="epub-sup">8</span></a> As a matter of logic, either the humanities and social sciences are coterminous with the abuses denounced in this book, or they are not. If they are, then we would indeed be attacking those fields <span class="epub-i">en bloc,</span> but it would be justified. And if not (as we believe), there is simply no reason to criticize one scholar for what another in the same field says. More generally, any construal of our book as a blanket attack on X—whether X is French thought, the American cultural left or whatever—presupposes that the whole of X is permeated by the bad intellectual habits we are denouncing, and that charge has to be established by whoever makes it.</p>
<p class="tx">The debates sparked by Sokal’s hoax have come to encompass an ever-wider range of ever-more-tenuously related issues, concerning not only the conceptual status of scientific knowledge or the merits of French poststructuralism, but also the social role of science and technology, multiculturalism and “political correctness”, the academic left versus the academic right, and the cultural left versus the economic left. We want to emphasize that this book does <span class="epub-i">not</span> deal with most of these topics. In particular, the ideas analyzed here have little, if any, conceptual or logical connection with politics. Whatever one’s views on Lacanian mathematics or the theory-ladenness of observation, one may hold, without fear of contradiction, any view whatsoever on military spending, national health insurance, or gay marriage. There is, to be sure, a <span class="epub-i">sociological</span> link—though its magnitude is often exaggerated—between the “postmodernist” intellectual currents we are criticizing and some sectors of the American academic left. Were it not for this link, we would not mention politics at all. But we do not want our book to be seen as one more shot in the dreary “Culture Wars”, still less as one from the right. Critical thinking about the unfairness of our economic system and about racial and sexual oppression has grown in many academic institutions since the 1960s and has been subjected, in recent years, to much derision and unfair criticism. There is nothing in our book that can be construed, even remotely, in that genre.</p>
<p class="tx">Our book faces a quite different institutional context in France and in the English-speaking world. While the authors we criticize have had a profound impact on French higher education and have numerous disciples in the media, the publishing houses and the intelligentsia—hence some of the furious reactions to our book—their Anglo-American counterparts are still an embattled minority within intellectual circles (though a well-entrenched one in some strongholds). This tends to make them look more “radical” and “subversive” than they really are, both in their own eyes and in those of their critics. But our book is not against political radicalism, it is against intellectual confusion. Our aim is not to criticize the left, but to help defend it from a trendy segment of itself. Michael Albert, writing in <span class="epub-i">Z Magazine,</span> summarized this well: “There is nothing truthful, wise, humane, or strategic about confusing hostility to injustice and oppression, which is leftist, with hostility to science and rationality, which is nonsense.”<a href="note.html#preface-9" id="pre-9"><span class="epub-sup">9</span></a></p>

<p class="sb">This edition is, in most respects, a straight translation from the French original. We have omitted a chapter on the misunderstandings of relativity by Henri Bergson and his successors, which seemed to us of marginal interest for most British and American readers.<a href="note.html#preface-10" id="pre-10"><span class="epub-sup">10</span></a> Conversely, we have expanded a few discussions concerning intellectual debates in the English-speaking world. We have also made many small changes to improve the clarity of the original text, to correct minor imprecisions, and to forestall misunderstandings. We thank the many readers of the French edition who offered us their suggestions.</p>
<p class="tx">While writing this book, we have benefited from innumerable discussions and debates and have received much encouragement and criticism. Although we are unable to thank individually all those who have contributed, we do want to express our gratitude to those who helped us by pointing out references or by reading and criticizing parts of the manuscript: Michael Albert, Robert Alford, Roger Balian, Louise Barre, Paul Boghossian, Raymond Boudon, Pierre Bourdieu, Jacques Bouveresse, Georges Bricmont, James Robert Brown, Tim Budden, Noam Chomsky, Helena Cronin, Bérangère Deprez, Jean Dhombres, Cryano de Dominicis, Pascal Engel, Barbara Epstein, Roberto Fernández, Vincent Fleury, Julie Franck, Allan Franklin, Paul Gérardin, Michel Gevers, Michel Ghins, Yves Gingras, Todd Gitlin, Gerald Goldin, Sylviane Goraj, Paul Gross, Étienne Guyon, Michael Harris, Géry-Henri Hers, Gerald Holton, John Huth, Markku Javanainen, Gérard Jorland, Jean-Michel Kantor, Noretta Koertge, Hubert Krivine, Jean-Paul Krivine, Antti Kupiainen, Louis Le Borgne, Gérard Lemaine, Geert Lernout, Jerrold Levinson, Norm Levitt, Jean-Claude Limpach, Andréa Loparic, John Madore, Christian Maes, Francis Martens, Tim Maudlin, Sy Mauskopf, Jean Mawhin, Maria McGavigan, N.
