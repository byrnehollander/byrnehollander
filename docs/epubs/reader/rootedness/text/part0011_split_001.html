      <p class="pf"><a id="p113" class="page1"></a>It is no coincidence that Weil and Heidegger turned to similar metaphors as they tried to save Europe from itself. That two thinkers of such different backgrounds—one a Parisian woman of Jewish ancestry who converted to Christianity and was raised in an affluent family, and the other a man from a Catholic, lower-middle-class family in rural Germany who was complicit with National Socialism—would arrive at similar metaphors as the solution to Europe’s woes attests to the ubiquity of the human-as-rooted-being trope during the period. Roots were in the air. In Germany, the term <i class="calibre1">Volksgemeinschaft</i>, or “people’s community,” was used as the organizing slogan during World War I to give a sense of <i class="calibre1">Verwurzelung</i> (rootedness) in the <i class="calibre1">Vaterland</i> and was later taken up by the National Socialists. In France, colonialism and the rhetoric of French universalism thrived under the Third Republic, despite the tense nationalist debates of the period.<a id="fn214r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn214">2</a> This overlap of identity politics and territory disputes kept root language at the surface of public discourse. The incident in which the root made its most spectacular appearance was the early-twentieth-century debate between André Gide and Maurice Barrès known as the <i class="calibre1">Querelle du peuplier</i> (the Poplar Quarrel). This battle royale between the <i class="calibre1">nomades</i> and the <i class="calibre1">sédentaires</i> was the extension of the age-old European dispute about who counts as rooted.<a id="fn215r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn215">3</a> Given the fallout from the Dreyfus Affair and the ceaseless polemics surrounding the political exclusion of the so-called Wandering Jew, the debate between these two writers became a public outlet for anti-Semitic opinions, in both thinly veiled and conspicuous formats. The argument began in 1897 with Gide’s critique of Barrès’s just-published <i class="calibre1">roman</i> <a id="p114" class="page1"></a><i class="calibre1">à thèse The Uprooted</i> (<i class="calibre1">Les déracinés</i>, 1897), dedicated to Paul Bourget<a id="fn216r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn216">4</a> and the first in a series of three novels under the name <i class="calibre1">The Novel of National Energy (Le roman de l’énergie nationale)</i>.<a id="fn217r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn217">5</a> His <i class="calibre1">Déracinés</i> argued in no uncertain terms that young Frenchmen from the countryside should avoid cities and should develop and nourish roots in their regions of origin. Barrès’s novel, influenced by Hippolyte Taine’s theoretical take on rootedness and Guy de Maupassant’s literary one,<a id="fn218r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn218">6</a> dramatized the regionalist celebration of his precious Lorraine. Uprooted people—namely, Jews, foreigners, and cosmopolitan intellectuals—were enemies of regional, cultural embeddedness. Emily Apter sees in the debate an emphasis on “the extent to which determinations of modern identity stubbornly revert to literal figurations of the botanics of roots and the physicality of land.”<a id="fn219r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn219">7</a> Barrès, a <i class="calibre1">boulangiste</i> and anti-Dreyfusard, spent his entire public life rallying the nation through his fiction, essays, journalism, and heavy political involvement. As Sarah Hammerschlag has argued, “nationalism, not Catholicism, served in the role of religion for Barrès.”<a id="fn220r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn220">8</a> Gide, in contrast, argued that extensive travel, which constitutes a special kind of learning, could provide for the strong character an occasion to increase the originality of thinking or acting.<a id="fn221r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn221">9</a> Encouraging weak-willed people to stay at home, Gide wrote bitingly: “Leave rootedness to the weak ones; let them stay encrusted in their hereditary habits, which will keep them from getting cold.”<a id="fn222r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn222">10</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">This well-documented and thoroughly analyzed debate, which unfolded as a ridiculous exchange of reviews and open letters informed by the research of sylviculturists, gardeners, and botanists, spun into utter silliness, with humans <a id="p115" class="page1"></a>being compared to poplar trees, lettuces, roses, cattle, and a seal.<a id="fn223r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn223">11</a> Experts in botany and zoology piped up to clarify whether a better analogy could be made between the human and this species or that one. In an atmosphere of entrenched positivism, science came to the aid of the participants’ relentless literalization of the metaphor. Scientists clarified many specialized terms, and the argument shifted to a semantic one with dissension over the glossing of words like <i class="calibre1">transplantation</i>, <i class="calibre1">dépaysement</i>, <i class="calibre1">déracinement</i>, <i class="calibre1">repiquage</i>, and <i class="calibre1">aération</i>. Perhaps the most excessive part was the avalanche of autobiographical details that many of the authors felt the need to disclose in order to bolster their claims, divulging details of where they were born, where their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents had lived, the lifelong <i class="calibre1">parcours</i> that led from this city to that, into the country and back.<a id="fn224r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn224">12</a> By itemizing their ancestors and each place where they had lived, these writers mobilized their autobiographies as proof. Origin became argument. Each person took himself as a case study, evidence to support whatever happened to be the person’s position in the debate. On the conservative side, staunch nationalist declarations abounded, like that <a id="p116" class="page1"></a>of Charles Maurras, who wrote, “The homeland [<i class="calibre1">la patrie</i>] is a point of view, a constant one.”<a id="fn225r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn225">13</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Ihab Hassan, Emily Apter, and others have described the twentieth century as a shift from a root-based epistemology to a rhizomatic one,<a id="fn226r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn226">14</a> and it is clear that in the <i class="calibre1">Querelle du peuplier</i> Gide’s position already hinted at the coming rhizomatic age. His celebration of nomadism was glossed in the late twentieth century by thinkers who tried to conflate rootedness and rootlessness into a unified concept: rootedness in rootlessness. Several applications of this concept—including Jacques Derrida’s <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>, Edouard Glissant’s <i class="calibre1">errance enracinée</i>, Jean-Claude Charles’s <i class="calibre1">enracinerrance</i>, and Vilém Flusser’s “taking up residence in homelessness”—express a will to reconcile the polarities that turn migration and dwelling into politically charged acts. While Derrida’s term, which fuses the words <i class="calibre1">destin</i> or <i class="calibre1">destinée</i> (destiny or fate) and <i class="calibre1">errance</i> (wandering), ostensibly involves the communicative deficiency that keeps a message from getting where it’s going, the idea can be extended to describe the constant communicative distance that separates one person or one culture from another. Martin Jay calls it “the inevitable process of miscommunication.”<a id="fn227r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn227">15</a> In what most closely resembles a definition, Derrida describes <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i> as “the possibility for a gesture not to arrive at its destination.”<a id="fn228r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn228">16</a> J. Hillis Miller calls <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i> “a spatial figure for time” and writes that the term “names a fatal possibility of erring by not reaching a predefined temporal goal in terms of wandering away from a predefined spatial goal. <i class="calibre1">Destinerrance</i> is like a loose thread in a tangled skein that turns out to lead to the whole ball of yarn.”<a id="fn229r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn229">17</a> This string theory is as fuzzy as Derrida’s concept. Miller, who scoured Derrida’s corpus trying (with little success) to find a clear definition and the original use of <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>, expresses reservations about the term and his attempt to define it; he is aware of the traps Derrida sets for readers and of the unintended straying from what was meant. He <a id="p117" class="page1"></a>proceeds anyway, defining <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i> as the conditions of possibility that “any utterance or writing I make may escape my intentions both as to what it should mean (for others), and as to the destination it is supposed to reach. I may be destined to err and to wander, even though it may sometimes, by a happy accident, reach the destination intended for it” (896–97). Miller points toward the important etymological link between the word “error” and the notion of straying (<i class="calibre1">errare</i> in Latin means both “to stray” and “to err”). His reasoning leads him to conclude that there is a measure of joy in the near misses of communication, that the destiny of a message (or a person) to wander, never fully reaching a recipient or a destination, is not cause for anxiety but an occasion for “playful exuberance.”<a id="fn230r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn230">18</a> In the case of textual <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>, thematic coherency is replaced by digression; logic is resisted; the root is rhizomatized. Already in Derrida’s half-hearted theorization of the concept, one perceives his preemptive certainty that it won’t reach the audience in the way he intended. Why bother to give a solid and stable form to a concept that is bound to liquefy on contact with the receiver or that will never make it to her at all? The notion of the self as a message that is never received, that is misinterpreted, or that is only partially comprehended communicates an anxiety about the gaps that separate one human from the next. All of the space that partitions one person from another contains within it the possibility for endless deferrals of meaning. The wandering destiny of the message, encoded in a body, goes astray. Miller is right to note the autobiographical inflections of Derrida’s writing on <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>; the philosopher uses his theorization to depressurize a nervousness about incommunicability. A minor adjustment in thinking about messages that move erratically transforms anxiety into joy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Glissant, in his reflections on <i class="calibre1">errance enracinée</i>, turns to the poet Saint-John Perse (Alexis Leger), the French national born in Guadeloupe who won the Nobel Prize in 1960. Glissant argues that Saint-John Perse idealized European poetry and placed himself in a European cultural genealogy rather than a Caribbean one. For him, poetry found its source “in an idea, in a desire, not in the literal fact of the birth.”<a id="fn231r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn231">19</a> The tensions between <i class="calibre1">ici</i> (here, the destination of <a id="p118" class="page1"></a>Europe for which he strived) and <i class="calibre1">ailleurs</i> (elsewhere, the Caribbean whence he came)—paradoxical in Glissant’s terms, since the “here” is typically where you are and the “elsewhere” is the place you could go—are felt in every page of Saint-John Perse’s poetry. He manages to convey a universality through his rootedness in wandering, suggesting that individuals can free themselves from history and home and gain autonomy through their chosen name, a symbol of breaking ties with the circumstances life has imposed. Glissant argues that Saint-John Perse’s poetry “heralds a new relation with the Other, which, paradoxically and precisely because of this passion for wandering, foretells the poetics of Relation.”<a id="fn232r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn232">20</a> Saint-John Perse’s rootedness in errantry makes him the forerunner of the late-twentieth-century gravitation toward <i class="calibre1">Créolité</i> and archipelagic and relational thinking in the Caribbean.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Jean-Claude Charles (1949–2008), a Haitian writer who lived much of his life between New York and Paris, introduced the idea of <i class="calibre1">enracinerrance</i>, which contains both rootedness (<i class="calibre1">enracinement</i>) and wandering (<i class="calibre1">errance</i>), in a book published in 1980, the same year as <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>, called <i class="calibre1">Le corps noir</i> (The black body).<a id="fn233r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn233">21</a> Coincidentally, this text impeccably performs the same rhizomatic progression advocated by Deleuze and Guattari in their 1976 write-up of the rhizome concept and again in <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>.<a id="fn234r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn234">22</a> Charles describes <i class="calibre1">enracinerrance</i> as a “deliberately oxymoronic term” that “simultaneously takes into account rootedness and wandering, the memory of origins and the new realities of migration; it takes account of the rootedness in wandering.”<a id="fn235r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn235">23</a> He acknowledges awareness of Derrida’s concept of <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>, which he takes to mean “a destiny of wandering” and distances himself from what he reads as <a id="p119" class="page1"></a>Derrida’s autobiographical appropriation of the word.<a id="fn236r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn236">24</a> Charles goes on to explain that he sees himself as an <i class="calibre1">enracinerrant</i>, and that no other terms—he cites “migrant writer,” “cosmopolitan writer,” “citizen of the world,” “writer without borders,” “transnational writer”—could accommodate him. His regular itinerary—a large geography of perpetual circulation in the shape of a triangle whose downward tip is Haiti and whose upended base angles are the United States and France—is a tree whose roots are everywhere. Refusing the notion of an “authentic Haiti,” delivered via the “constant blahblah” of those he calls the “identity cops” (39–40), Charles prefers an open-ended and multiplicitous take on what could be the character that geographic spaces lend to the people who inhabit them, an experientially additive rather than subtractive approach to travel and residence. Open-endedness and a logic of accumulation guide the spirit of <i class="calibre1">enracinerrance</i>, whose principle is this: “Let the entire world circulate” (39). We can read Charles’s theorization of his neologism as the attempt to reconcile two historically antithetical tendencies—one to move and the other to keep still—that characterize his own identity. Drawing from experiential observations and profoundly felt pain, Charles is an authority on nomadic living. One gets the sense that his theorizations are not theoretical at all but are instead the living, empirical account of a life lived in transit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Vilém Flusser (1920–1991), a Czech-born Jewish writer who lived for long periods in Brazil, France, Germany, and other places, pursued the theme of the creative benefits of exile, nomadism, and homelessness throughout his writing life. In his youth, he fled from Prague after the Nazi occupation in 1939. He lost most of his family and everyone in his entourage to the camps. This scholar, whose perpetual circulation began under these traumatic circumstances, found a way to reconceptualize nomadism not as a misfortune but as a gift. He argues that we should not pity “the uncounted millions of emigrants (whether [they] are guest workers, expellees, or intellectuals traveling from one seminar to another),” including the “Vietnamese in California, the Turks in Germany, the Palestinians in the Persian Gulf, and the Russian scientists at Harvard”; instead they should be considered “pioneers of the future” and “role models whose examples we follow in case we are sufficiently daring.”<a id="fn237r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn237">25</a> Echoing Levinas’s critique of Heidegger, whose desire for a return to the root he considered residually pagan and childish, Flusser claims that the attachment to home is <a id="p120" class="page1"></a>the result of a subconscious fetal attachment to the motherland. Like Levinas, Flusser is suspicious of the secret. Concepts that must hide themselves in order to remain functional do their work surreptitiously because a full exposure would reveal the inherent weakness of the concept. Mystification is the only thing that enables their existence. Flusser, like Levinas before him, wants to shine a bright light on these weaknesses. Using metaphors of vision, Flusser describes the process of self-enlightenment with regard to the root. Blindness toward the home occurs because of the numbing effects of habit, repetition, and the banal aspects of daily living. He claims that “every home is a sacralization of the banal. . . . Whatever its shape, home is nothing more than a place to live surrounded by mysteries” (99). Home, then, is “a network of habits” (100). Flusser makes the distinction between “home” and “a home,” claiming that everyone, even the homeless who live under bridges, has a home. When one is away from home, data transforms from meaningful information into meaningless noise. In an aesthetic excursus, Flusser reformulates his notion—reiterated throughout his corpus—that the cycle of aesthetics begins with the ugly (what is unfamiliar), then becomes beautiful (when the unfamiliar begins to yield information to the person who beholds it), then pretty (when beauty becomes dull), and finally ugly again (when the pretty becomes superfluous). He argues that “patriotism is a symptom of an aesthetic disease” (101), because it involves the confusion of prettiness for beauty, the belief that your home is more beautiful than anyone else’s. The stranger or foreigner embodies the possibility that one’s own home is just one among many, rendering the home unmagical, unspecial, and unsingular. This is, in part, why we fear the stranger. In his essay “Exile and Creativity,” Flusser celebrates exile as the possibility of removing the blanket called habit, which covers everything in one’s home. This unveiling precipitates a new visibility, a new possibility to glean information from one’s own home. In his view, this is what connects “the Christian story of man’s expulsion from Paradise and his entrance into the world, the Jewish mystic’s story of the exile of divine spirit in the world, and the existentialist story of man as a stranger in the world”: Each created the conditions of a creative and defamiliarized engagement with an alien world. The “ocean of chaotic information” involved in the experience of exile creates the potential for creation, which he defines simply as “data transformation.”<a id="fn238r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn238">26</a> Flusser asks a pointed question: “Even without intending to do so, have the expellers not done the expelled a service?” Flusser celebrates all that <i class="calibre1">un-settles</i>. Despite the belief on the part of rooted peoples that they make history, Flusser argues instead <a id="p121" class="page1"></a>that the “uprooted make history” (105), an argument that annuls Deleuze and Guattari’s Nomadology-History dichotomy. “The Jews are not part of Nazi history,” he claims. “The Nazis are part of Jewish history” (107). He concludes, “Exile, no matter what form it takes, is a breeding ground for creative activity, for the new” (109). There is undoubtedly a therapeutic element in Flusser’s negotiation of his own nomadism, which he probably would not have chosen under less devastating circumstances. Part of the healing process involves <i class="calibre1">owning</i> what was thrust upon him. Embracing his self-expulsion is part of a quiet retribution in response to Nazi brutality. He attempts to change the narrative of who actually won, showing that exile keeps the spirit agile and clear-eyed, while sedentary life leads to blindness and cultural lethargy. The nomad takes his home with him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Because Weil and Heidegger were writing in a context long before syntheses like <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>, <i class="calibre1">errance enracinée</i>, <i class="calibre1">enracinerrance</i>, or taking up residence in homelessness had been proposed, they privileged the language of roots and were complicit in the more disquieting aspects of various pro-roots philosophies. It became clear that the root-centered debates of the period weren’t just about regionalism but were rather about the importance of ostracizing the uprooted and uprooting force represented, for example, by the Jews in the minds of the nationalists. Because, as Hannah Arendt has argued, much of modern anti-Semitism is caused by the “inability to understand historical contexts,”<a id="fn239r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn239">27</a> one sees in the provincialism of Barrès and his proponents a refusal to think in terms of causes rather than simplified and contextless effects. As argued in <a class="page1" href="part0008_split_000.html#ch01">chapter 1</a>, the lack of context—be it historical, geographic, natural, social—is the central cause of the most devastating events in the modern age. One could say that the nationalist and anti-Semitic arguments that circulated in Weil and Heidegger’s time were uprooted from history, ignoring the long chronicle of Europe’s relation to Judaism, urbanization, and politically motivated <a id="p122" class="page1"></a>circulation. Paradoxically, rootedness to an idealized past often involves a total ignorance of history. Ultimately, Barrès expresses the same paganistic separation from historical time as do Heidegger and the National Socialists. This militant paganism, what Ernst Bloch has called <i class="calibre1">pastorale militans</i><a id="fn240r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn240">28</a>—visible, for example, in the botanical language of Hitler’s <i class="calibre1">Mein Kampf</i><a id="fn241r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn241">29</a>—tries to set up a configuration in which the neo-pagans have nature on their side against the enemy. Aligned with this omnipresent and indomitable force, those who worship nature celebrate a distinct advantage over those they see as alienated from nature. As we will see, Blanchot and Levinas noted this paganistic tendency in right-wing politics and proposed a celebration of Judaism’s nomadism and its tendency away from nature worship. The long history of the <i class="calibre1">völkische Bewegung</i>—the populist movement in Germany that conjugated the natural world, folklore and mysticism, romantic nationalism, and bloodlines—constitutes what Blanchot and Levinas see as the actual uprooting force in Europe. It is not, in their view, the Jews who have uprooted Europe. On the contrary, it is those who have invested the land with a holiness that causes alienation, turf wars, and other forms of primitivistic exclusion. This <i class="calibre1">Blut und Boden</i> mythology does not belong exclusively to Germany; we find it even in <a id="p123" class="page1"></a>the <i class="calibre1">Marseillaise</i>, the French national anthem, albeit as an evocation of the enemy’s spilt blood and not that of the French themselves:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Marchons, marchons,</p>
        <p class="sl">Qu’un sang impur</p>
        <p class="sl">abreuve nos sillons</p>
        <p class="sl">(Let us march, let us march,</p>
        <p class="sl">Til their impure blood</p>
        <p class="sl">Soaks our furrows)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Yet the adjective “impure,” used to describe foreign blood, participates in the same logic as discourses of Aryan supremacy, eugenics, and other National Socialist tropes of racial primacy. The most evil acts in twentieth-century Europe were precipitated by root thinking. What exactly grows from fields soaked with enemy blood?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The relationship of Weil and Heidegger to Judaism is crucial to a full account of how and why these thinkers both came to embrace a vocabulary of roots in the period surrounding the war. Numerous fragments from Weil’s writings make it clear that she viewed Jews as a rootless people and that she had a distinct distaste for the violence in the Hebrew Bible; she blamed Jews for everything from the Inquisition to twentieth-century capitalism and totalitarianism.<a id="fn242r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn242">30</a> Weil’s position that they were responsible for uprooting Western <a id="p124" class="page1"></a>civilization stands in opposition to Levinas’s argument that Christianity uproots the individual.<a id="fn243r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn243">31</a> She was intimately familiar with the term <i class="calibre1">déraciné</i> and perhaps subconsciously took this term as an insult to her own person, given her Jewish lineage. If Weil was really a self-hating Jew, as she has been dubbed by so many critics, it is reasonable to suggest that she valued the very quality her ancestors could never achieve in the minds of many Europeans, namely, rootedness. And even if, as Levinas and Palle Yourgrau have argued, Weil was not an anti-Semite but someone who disliked the brutality of certain episodes of the Hebrew Bible and who opposed in any form the election or supremacy of one race over another, the term <i class="calibre1">déraciné</i> as an adjective to describe the Jews in France was omnipresent in the period in which she lived, from the echoes of anti-Dreyfusard rhetoric to Barrès’s <i class="calibre1">Les déracinés</i>. The metaphor was ineluctable. In Heidegger’s case, his adherence to an anti-Semitic ideology is clear. Stereotypes about Judaism led Weil and Heidegger, consciously or unconsciously, to their rhizophilic stance and their application of a pro-roots philosophy to matters that had ostensibly nothing to do with the Jews. In other words, the trope of the wandering Jew—<i class="calibre1">le Juif errant</i> or <i class="calibre1">der Ewige Jude</i>—which both thinkers undoubtedly encountered early in their studies and as a central trope in the political debates of the period, initiated their worldview that humans are rooted creatures. Without this commonplace, it is unlikely that they would have arrived nearly simultaneously at these strikingly similar motifs of rootedness and groundedness. They were not the only ones touched by the trope. The myth of rootedness was in the air; scientists, writers, philosophers, and politicians referred to it in some form, from ethnogeographic studies to regionalist novels to wartime propaganda, nearly always in reference to a politics of belonging.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">For Heidegger, the Jew represented what was <i class="calibre1">unfaßbar</i> (intangible, ungraspable, or inconceivable), a quality he claims led to Europe’s woes: “World <a id="p125" class="page1"></a>Jewry, spurred on by the emigrants who’ve been allowed out of Germany, is intangible everywhere and, as much as it develops its power, never has to take part in activities of war, whereas the only thing left for us is to sacrifice the best blood of the best of our own people.”<a id="fn244r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn244">32</a> Again, the <i class="calibre1">Luftmenschen</i> trope, alluded to in <a class="page1" href="part0009_split_000.html#ch02">chapter 2</a>, takes shape here as the picture of a people who slip through the fingers, living abstractions whose lack of concreteness still manages to hammer Europe apart. Shunning the accusation that anti-Semitism is a racial question, he transforms it into a metaphysical question, claiming that Jews are responsible for the uprooting of Being.<a id="fn245r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn245">33</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Another root fixation that appealed to both Weil and Heidegger was an attachment to Greece as the cultural cradle of Germany and France. When seeking nostalgic inspiration from their forebears, the Europeans can always turn back to the Greeks.<a id="fn246r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn246">34</a> One of the most stable aspects of Heidegger’s corpus is his Graecophilia.<a id="fn247r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn247">35</a> In 1924 he announced to his students: “We need to win back rootedness and autochthony as it was alive in Greek science.”<a id="fn248r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn248">36</a> Deleuze and Guattari claim that the confused attempt to get to the origin or the ground, <a id="p126" class="page1"></a>to recognize in the Germans the lost greatness of the Greeks, caused Heidegger to mistakenly take “not only the German for a Greek but the fascist for a creator of existence and freedom.” In short, they argue: “He got the wrong people, earth, and blood.”<a id="fn249r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn249">37</a> Charles Bambach outlines in detail the forms of Heidegger’s attachment and indebtedness to the Greeks, using Nietzsche’s philhellenism as the bridge between them. He summarizes the complex lineage of Heideggerian thought in this passage: “In the curious and fateful conjoining of Nietzschean <i class="calibre1">Kampf</i> and Hölderlinian <i class="calibre1">Heimat</i>, of Heraclitean <i class="calibre1">polemos</i> and Eckhartian <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i>, there emerges a Heideggerian philosophy of roots that both brings together and sets asunder the counterposed realms of the martial and the pastoral.”<a id="fn250r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn250">38</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">This summary makes immediately clear some of the salient similarities and differences between Weil and Heidegger’s rhizophilia. What binds them is their mutual attraction to Greece and the belief that Europe must look back to Greece to save itself. Both Weil and Heidegger were greatly influenced by Meister Eckhart’s notion of detachment (<i class="calibre1">Abgeschiedenheit</i>), which in Weil’s work takes the form of <i class="calibre1">décréation</i> and in Heidegger’s, <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i>. Both thinkers were highly suspicious of the bourgeois class and both lamented the cultural legacy of the French Revolution. Both were opposed to the Treaty of Versailles, which they believed to be one of the worst tools of humiliation in the history of Europe and responsible in many respects for the gravity of World War II.<a id="fn251r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn251">39</a> The Hellenist Nicole Loraux has argued that for the Greeks themselves, humans were imagined to have come directly from the earth in one of two ways, either born directly “out of the soil like a plant or a child from the womb . . . ; according to other myths . . . the human creature, made of earth and fashioned by an artisanal god, is the product of a manufacturing.”<a id="fn252r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn252">40</a> Using this distinction, we might say that Heidegger pursues in his writing the lineage <a id="p127" class="page1"></a>of the first, while Weil combines both of these myths in her conception of human provenance. Her Christian faith nurtures the idea of a sculptor-God; her fondness for early Greek culture and its foundational myths fuses the idea of humanity as an earthen race, either as autochthonous creation or as sculpture.</p>
