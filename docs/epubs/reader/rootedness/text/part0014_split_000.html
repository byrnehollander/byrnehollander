      <h1 class="ct1">From Rhizome to Vegetal Democracy</h1>
      <p class="pf">If it is true—as Ihab Hassan, Emily Apter, and others have asserted—that the twentieth century represents a shift from a root-based epistemology to a rhizomatic one, one wonders whether the current call for vegetal democracy is a continuation of this “rhizomization,” or whether it is something else entirely. I don’t believe the new attention to plant life, as articulated in the work of thinkers like Matthew Hall, Eduardo Kohn, and Michael Marder, could have been possible without the strange path of the root metaphor I analyze in this book. As I will show, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari retained in their writing on the rhizome some of the mystical features of writers like Claudel, Heidegger, and Weil, which were passed on in turn to the new proponents of vegetal democracy. Furthermore, there is a shift in narrative, from a rejection of rootedness to what could be called “rootedness in rootlessness,” the attempt to find comfort in a world that has disposed of context. The overlap of politics and ecology, of human and plant, have led to the attempt to grant certain democratic rights to plants, an animistic gesture that invites paganism to infiltrate politics. Rhizome-centered thinking, which breaks the root and the power structures it represents into an unpredictable, undecidable abstraction, created the conditions under which the human loses its status as the universal sovereign over all other forms of life. In this final chapter, I tie together various strands that have run through this study, including the place of nationalism in our postnational moment, the place of metaphysics in our postmetaphysical moment, and the place of humanism in our posthuman moment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This chapter identifies Deleuze and Guattari’s work as the most important connecting link between the early-twentieth-century paganistic uses of <a id="p217" class="page1"></a>the plant-human nexus and the contemporary postnational, postmetaphysical, and posthuman tendencies in philosophy. I argue that their thought works as a kind of checkpoint through which several lines of rooted thinking passed and transformed. For example, on the identarian front, the root thinking of early-twentieth-century nationalists such as Barrès refracts through Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatic and nomadic metaphors and finds a place in the work of thinkers like Edouard Glissant and Antonio Benítez-Rojo, who identified the prescient Caribbean as the true site of a certain kind of laudable postmodern chaos.<a id="fn478r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn478">1</a> Their application of the rhizome metaphor, among other image concepts from <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i> and <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>, leads them to place a great amount of emphasis on the plantation as the primary structuring element of Caribbean culture. The plantation is where the human and the plant meet and where economic and social futures are shaped. Nature and culture intersect here. Deleuze and Guattari provided a visual language through which these various intersections could be sometimes fruitfully analyzed. Regarding the mystical strand of plant-centered thought, I show that a heavily mystical element is maintained, from those theories of rootedness formulated by Claudel, Heidegger, and Weil, then through the rhizome and nomad figures of Deleuze and Guattari, and, finally, to the mystically infused posthuman ontologies of thinkers like Matthew Hall, Eduardo Kohn, and Michael Marder, to mention only those who propose the plant world specifically as deserving of new focus. In other words, I attempt to make a case that a certain line of magical thought has led from Claudel and Weil’s Christian and Heidegger’s paganistic metaphysics through Deleuze and Guattari to the current proponents of vegetal democracy and plant thinking.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the final thoughts this book has to offer, I show how a hyperliteralization of the root metaphor has resulted from currents in poststructuralist and postmetaphysical thought and in new research in the fields of botany and anthropology. This literalization has led to the conclusion that the human-as-plant metaphor was never a metaphor. Humans and plants have always been in direct communication via their shared cellular consciousness, which is so intimately and reciprocally attuned that the boundaries between plant and human are dissolved. This theory explains our attraction to plants, our endless botanification of people and anthropomorphization of plants, and our <a id="p218" class="page1"></a>centuries-long insistence on the rootedness of humans. Matthew Hall’s <i class="calibre1">Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany</i> (2011), Eduardo Kohn’s <i class="calibre1">How Forests Think: Toward an Anthropology beyond the Human</i> (2013), and Michael Marder’s <i class="calibre1">Plant-Thinking: A Philosophy of Vegetal Life</i> (2013) are new poststructurally influenced reworkings of Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird’s <i class="calibre1">The Secret Life of Plants</i> (1973), which argued that plants merit the same consideration we give willingly to other humans and to some animals. We should behave more like plants, they argue, taking only what we need, slowing down our pace, and operating on the ethical principle of trans-species dignity.</p>
