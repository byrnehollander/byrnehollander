It is precisely the failure to confront or explicitly acknowledge the colonial experience that problematises the conflation of postcolonialism and post-structuralism.” Ahluwalia, <i class="calibre1">Out of Africa</i>, 3.</p>

For them, “The earth is not one element among others but rather brings together all the elements within a single embrace while using one or another of them to deterritorialize territory” (85). In an extended reading of Deleuze and Guattari’s geophilosophy, Gregory Flaxman writes, “Etymologically speaking, we propose to lay down a course that leads from a <i class="calibre1">gene-</i> qua genealogy to <i class="calibre1">geo</i>- qua geophilosophy—from familial and human lineages to the inhuman milieu of the earth. Insofar as genealogy describes our ‘all too human’ descent, in what sense could it possibly anticipate the movement outside humanity, to ‘a world without others’ (<i class="calibre1">un monde sans autrui</i>)—to the earth? How does genealogy, the study of ancestry, presage a geophilosophical practice in which ‘paternity does not exist’ and the subject dissolves in the slow passage of geological time?” He offers a new definition of genealogy as “a critique of origins that proceeds by foreclosing origins.” Flaxman, <i class="calibre1">Gilles Deleuze</i>, 73.</p>

L’institut du géopoétique, <a class="page1" href="http://www.geopoetique.net/archipel_fr/institut/texte_inaugural/index.html">www.geopoetique.net/archipel_fr/institut/texte_inaugural/index.html</a>, accessed March 20, 2014. White’s call for a new movement is marked by a language of fertility, foundation, and return. He conceives it as a borderless community with an interdisciplinary imperative, combining “poetry, thought, and science” and various disciplines like geography, biology, and ecology. Jed Rasula calls necropoetics “a pledge enacted between the dead and the living.” Rasula, <i class="calibre1">This Compost</i>, 65. Throughout the book, whose full title is <i class="calibre1">This Compost: Ecological Imperatives in American Poetry</i>, he uses the figure of composted material—including the bodies of the dead and other matter that was once living, which then transmutes again into living matter—as analogous to the poet’s processing of figuratively dead material into the (re)vitalized word.</p>

It is the surface on which the whole process of production is inscribed, on which the forces and means of labor are recorded, and the agents and the products distributed.” Deleuze and Guattari, <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i>, 140–41.</p>

And I said to Michel, “What the hell do you mean by that?” And he said, “He writes so obscurely you can’t tell what he’s saying, that’s the obscurantism part, and then when you criticize him, he can always say, ‘You didn’t understand me, you’re an idiot.’ That’s the terrorism part.”</p>

The West has a special relation to the forest, and deforestation; the fields carved from the forest are populated with seed plants produced by cultivation based on species lineages of the arborescent type; animal raising, carried out on fallow fields, selects lineages forming an entire animal arborescence. The East presents a different figure: a relation to the steppe and the garden (or in some cases, the desert and the oasis), rather than forest and field; cultivation of tubers by fragmentation of the individual; a casting aside or bracketing of animal raising, which is confined to closed spaces or pushed out onto the steppes of the nomads. The West: agriculture based on a chosen lineage containing a large number of variable individuals. The East: horticulture based on a small number of individuals derived from a wide range of “clones.” Does not the East, Oceania in particular, offer something like a rhizomatic model opposed in every respect to the Western model of the tree?</p>

To do so would be to render more refined the violence human thought has never ceased unleashing against these beings, for instance by forcing plants into the mold of appropriative subjectivity.” Marder, <i class="calibre1">Plant-Thinking</i>, 55. In a note, Marder specifies that he’s writing specifically about Matthew Hall’s <i class="calibre1">Plants as Persons</i>. While Marder may take issue with Hall’s anthropomorphization of plants, there is a great amount of overlap between their two projects. Both base many of their arguments on the early treatment of plants in Classic Greek philosophy; both challenge the notion of plant passivity; both look toward the East to find alternate ways of thinking about plants; both qualify the human treatment of plants as violent; and both attempt to rethink how we encounter plants using a wide variety of discourses.</p>

Vegetal afterlife, facilitated by the passage, the procession of the dead (including the decomposing parts of the plants themselves), through the roots to the stem and on to the flower, is a non-mystified and material “resurrection,” an opportunity for mortal remains to break free from the darkness of the earth. Thanks to the plant, fixed in place by its roots, dead plants, animals, and humans are unmoored from their “resting places”; they travel or migrate, just as in certain non-Western religion souls can find their reincarnation in plants.</p>
