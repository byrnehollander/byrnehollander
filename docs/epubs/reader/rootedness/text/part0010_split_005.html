      <p class="pf">Through the metaphor of the inverted plant, Paul Valéry casts his character Monsieur Teste as an exceptional brain, albeit of a very different sort from that of the philosopher-botanist depicted by Diderot and Daubenton. Valéry imagined knowledge to organize itself in the manner of a tree: “Knowledge extends like a tree, by a process identical to itself; by repeating itself. <i class="calibre1">Novat reiterando</i>. [It renews itself through repetition.]”<a id="fn190r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn190">45</a> It is not surprising, then, that the tree is a central figure in Valéry’s oeuvre, one so omnipresent that Pierre Laurette dedicated an entire book to parsing the tree imagery in the writer’s corpus.<a id="fn191r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn191">46</a> Nor is it surprising that Valéry would imbue his most cerebral character, Monsieur Teste, with botanical attributes. Valéry’s “Teste cycle” was published first as a series beginning in the late nineteenth century and then as a complete collection in the early twentieth century. Monsieur Teste is essentially an anthropomorphized thought. Valéry even went so far as to call the book “the novel of a brain” (“le roman d’un cerveau”).<a id="fn192r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn192">47</a> For him, the challenge of Teste’s <a id="p101" class="page1"></a>existence is one of duration: how to extend the duration of a thought on a page, thus giving it life, cultivating the potential of the seed? Monsieur Teste, whose name could mean “head” or “witness,”<a id="fn193r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn193">48</a> dedicated his existence to several tasks, the most important of which lies in his injunction “<i class="calibre1">Maturare!”</i> (“to ripen or mature” in the infinitive but with an implicit imperative entreaty), a vitalist notion depicting thought and body unfurling organically in time. Teste shows deep interest in human potential, particularly of the cognitive sort. The narrator who scrutinizes Teste’s words and movements in an effort to decipher the mechanism of that monstrous brain explains, “This man had known quite early the importance of what might be called human <i class="calibre1">plasticity</i>. He had investigated its mechanics and its limits. How deeply he must have reflected on his own malleability!”<a id="fn194r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn194">49</a> The question that haunts this singular figure the most is perhaps this: “Of what is man capable?” (23).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Among the texts of the Teste cycle, readers find a letter supposedly from Emilie, the wife of Monsieur Teste, to the friend who has narrated his experiences with the curious man in early texts like “La Soirée avec Monsieur Teste.” I write “supposedly” because Valéry includes a curious prefatory note in the letter’s first appearance in print, in the publication <i class="calibre1">Commerce</i> in the fall of 1924. This note is ostensibly written by the editors of the publication (“la Direction”) and calls into question the authenticity of Emilie Teste’s testimony about her husband: “We wondered whether this letter was perhaps forged by Mr. Teste himself, with some inexplicable intent.”<a id="fn195r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn195">50</a> The editors (or their fictional avatars as imagined by Valéry) are specifically hesitant in regard to the style of the letter (“It is hardly the language of a woman one finds in it”)<a id="fn196r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn196">51</a> and the idiosyncrasies of the writing, such as “a certain absence of restraint and modesty in the expression,”<a id="fn197r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn197">52</a> all of which leads them to believe that Teste has ventriloquized his own wife, if she even exists at all. This “Note de la <a id="p102" class="page1"></a>Direction” did not appear in later editions of the Teste cycle. It is implied that if the letter was written by Teste himself and not his wife, it is an opportunity for the man to communicate to his friend, the letter’s addressee, his own (idealized) account of how he should be seen. The strange configuration of writing himself through another allows him to convey both his inner and outer features, those that are manifest to him and those perceived by others in a single portrait. He takes himself as an object of study, trying to adopt a point of view he could not possibly have.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Because the fictional editors were unsure of the letter’s authenticity and this letter was left out of later editions of the Teste cycle, let’s momentarily suspend our misgivings and trust that Emilie is in fact its fictional author. She compares her husband to “a mystic without God” (31) and notes, as so many others have, that the man’s strange cerebral pursuits can be perceived but not understood by those who observe him. He must use his entire vital strength to pull himself from the depths of his mental digressions and restore contact with the extracerebral world.<a id="fn198r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn198">53</a> The letter abounds with botanical imagery,<a id="fn199r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn199">54</a> but one of these metaphors is particularly striking: Emilie describes her husband’s soul as an inverted plant. She writes, “His soul, no doubt, changes into some peculiar plant whose root, and not the foliage, would thrust against nature toward the light!”<a id="fn200r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn200">55</a> Valéry’s Platonic reference is clear. However, given that Teste is compared to a mystic without God, the preoccupations of his soul are not bound to divine transcendence but to some other kind of transcendence, still tied to the <i class="calibre1">esprit</i> but to the cognitive rather than the spiritual kind. Throughout the Teste cycle, his freakish or monstrous nature is emphasized, suggesting that he is an inverted human, an aberration. An archaic term in both French and English for a homosexual was “invert” (<i class="calibre1">inverti</i>), one who goes against nature, <i class="calibre1">à rebours</i>. Teste, too, goes against nature, not bodily but cerebrally. Despite his <a id="p103" class="page1"></a>efforts toward a higher order of cognition, he still seeks groundedness, in an alternation between testing the limits of human consciousness and returning to his wife, who provides a solid ground after these mental divagations and who represents the world, the Earth Mother. As a transposition of the typical human, whose base corporeal needs take precedence over mental life, Teste is a textual model for how to do one thing in particular: “Penser autrement.”</p>
