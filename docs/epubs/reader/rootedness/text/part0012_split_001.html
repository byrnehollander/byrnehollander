      <p class="pf">The most famous <i class="calibre1">mise-en-scène</i> of the root and its symbolic challenges to rational thought is found in Sartre’s <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i>. The protagonist, Antoine Roquentin, settles in Bouville, which elicits through the French ear the image of a city of mud (<i class="calibre1">boue</i> + <i class="calibre1">ville</i>) or a city of the bottom or the end (<i class="calibre1">bout</i> + <i class="calibre1">ville</i>). This is the first of many abject cues; the novel displays wide-ranging forms of filth. As a historian conducting research on the life of the Marquis de Rollebon, Roquentin spends many of his waking hours in a veritable forest, the library, whose books, tables, and chairs are composed of wood. He lives alone and manifests the anxieties of the typical modern subject: he simultaneously fears alienation and the company of other humans; he feels his existence to be superfluous but continues to play his human role, each day going through the motions of societally programmed living; he finds culture and nature irreconcilable.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The botanical world imposes itself on the human throughout Sartre’s narrative, even before the moment of illumination at the foot of the chestnut tree. In one passage, Roquentin studies his own face in the mirror and describes what he sees as “well below a monkey, on the fringe of the vegetable world.”<a id="fn313r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn313">2</a> He likens his own hair to blades of grass (137). He describes the cashier of the Café Mably as a “fleshy white plant” (78) seen externally through the café window. Fleshy plants under the rainy skies of Bouville take on the texture and form of human ears.<a id="fn314r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn314">3</a> Violet—as a flower, a color, and a smell—is associated throughout the novel with loss, death, and the grotesque; it is the hue <a id="p157" class="page1"></a>of unease and disease. Other flowers, such as the lily and the rose, also come to represent human death. As Bataille has argued, the flower is indissociable from sex, although the relationship between the two requires a displacement of the true locus of desire, the sexual organ, to a secondary site.<a id="fn315r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn315">4</a> A young, deceased student of the Polytechnique in a portrait hanging in the Bouville museum is described as a cut rose, after a quotation from Anchises about Augustus’s nephew Marcellus in Virgil’s <i class="calibre1">Aeneid</i>: “<i class="calibre1">Tu Marcellus eris! Manibus date lilia plenis</i>” (translatable as “A new Marcellus shall arrive in thee” or “You will be Marcellus, give lilies with full hands”).<a id="fn316r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn316">5</a> The mushroom, a truly abject botanical form, inseparable from dirt and rot, also appears in Roquentin’s pages. The narrator imagines his new life in Paris as a “mushroom existence” (231), and his former lover Anny describes the mildewed pages of the large tome of Michelet’s <i class="calibre1">History</i> as having the same color and smell as a mushroom (196).<a id="fn317r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn317">6</a> It is worth recalling that Freud used the form of the mushroom to describe the structure of a dream.<a id="fn318r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn318">7</a> Roquentin also recalls Pascal’s image of the human as a thinking reed.<a id="fn319r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn319">8</a> He even describes human consciousness in botanical terms, writing in his journal, “Consciousness exists as a tree, as a blade of grass” (227).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The protagonist falls asleep into a monstrous botanical dreamscape while fondling the owner of <i class="calibre1">Rendez-vous des Cheminots</i>. This woman elicits disgust in him, as “she is too white and besides, she smells like a newborn child” (82). In <i class="calibre1">Being and Nothingness</i>, Sartre argues that “erotic descriptions insist on the smooth whiteness of a woman’s body” because “what is smooth can be taken and felt but remains no less impenetrable, does not give way in the least beneath the appropriative caress—it is like water.” Sartre explains, “The idea of <a id="p158" class="page1"></a>‘carnal possession’ offers us the irritating but seductive figure of a body perpetually possessed and perpetually new, on which possession leaves no trace.”<a id="fn320r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn320">9</a> La Patronne, as she is called, has countless lovers, but the signs of their sexual encounters leave no trace. Roquentin is repulsed by this whiteness, the same color used to describe fleshy plants in the scenes mentioned above. As he falls asleep, the latent horror contained in her person comes alive in his subconscious:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">I played distractedly with her sex under the cover; then my arm went to sleep. I thought about de Rollebon: after all, why shouldn’t I write a novel on his life? I let my arm run along the woman’s thigh and suddenly saw a small garden with low, wide trees on which immense hairy leaves were hanging. Ants were running everywhere, centipedes and ringworm. There were even more horrible animals: their bodies were made from a slice of toast, the kind you put under roast pigeons; they walked sideways with legs like a crab. The larger leaves were black with beasts. Behind the cactus and the Barbary fig trees, the Velleda of the public park pointed a finger at her sex. “This park smells of vomit,” I shouted. (82–83)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">This passage highlights a <i class="calibre1">topos</i> in French literature, particularly since the period of the Decadents, of holding the botanical world in contempt as the vile force that encroaches upon the human world. In his book <i class="calibre1">Forests: The Shadow of Civilization</i>, Robert Harrison writes, “Nothing . . . disquiets a rationalist more than a forest.”<a id="fn321r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn321">10</a> Jean Pierrot takes a similar position, identifying what he calls “la revanche du végétal” (revenge of the plant world) in the French literary canon, particularly starting in the second half of the nineteenth century. Pierrot illustrates the ubiquity of the belief that plants work against human progress and the fear that they will eventually erase civilization. Offering a wide range of examples, starting with Emile Zola and ending with Roger Caillois, Pierrot argues that from the late nineteenth century onward, “the plant would be considered an essentially dangerous reality for man. It would appear to seek revenge for the long subjugation imposed on it by man, attempting to reverse in its favor, through the image of a rivalry between different species, the reign humans believed to have permanently established on Earth.”<a id="fn322r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn322">11</a> Behind the veil of threatening greenery, other hostile entities lurk. Ants, centipedes, and <a id="p159" class="page1"></a>ringworms infest Roquentin’s dream scene; these can bite, sting, or infect the human. The edible human is also the eating human, implied through the surreal image of the toast-shaped animals that move like crabs. In this moment, meaning breaks down completely, following the logic of the abject as defined by Kristeva.<a id="fn323r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn323">12</a> The crab is a recurring figure throughout <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i> and is most memorable perhaps as Roquentin’s own hand, which he perceives as detached from his body, having taken on a life of its own. This disconnectedness of the hand from the body is also prefigured here as Roquentin’s arm falls asleep; the arm becomes sensorially detached from his body, a foreign object whose sensations are absent or at least distant. Roquentin dwells on descriptions of the hands of the Self-Taught Man (<i class="calibre1">l’Autodidacte</i>), a humanist who frequents the same library as Roquentin, which reach for the hands of young boys. In <i class="calibre1">Being and Nothingness</i>, in the section on bad faith (<i class="calibre1">mauvaise foi</i>), Sartre depicts the scene of a woman unwilling to decide whether she wants to sleep with a man who is courting her and describes the way she lets her hand transform into a thing detached from her body, which her suitor may fondle at will without any commitment from her person.<a id="fn324r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn324">13</a> Roquentin’s dream ends with the eruption from his throat of the mysterious phrase, “Ce jardin sent le vomi,” a prefiguration of the scene in the Jardin public when the cause of his nausea becomes clear. The overtly sexual nature of this excerpt and its relation to the garden summon up images of the Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Many abject scenes in the novel foreshadow Roquentin’s illumination. One of the most striking of these is triggered when Roquentin buys a newspaper that announces that the raped body of a little girl named Lucienne has been found. Previously, as Roquentin passed through the Jardin public, he had noticed a man in a large cloak sitting on a bench, perhaps about to expose himself to a little girl around ten years of age. Roquentin unintentionally disturbs “their little drama” (109–10),<a id="fn325r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn325">14</a> scaring the little girl away. The headline about <a id="p160" class="page1"></a>dead Lucienne may recall this earlier scene of sexual invasiveness. The name Lucienne is a variant of the name Lucie, meaning “light,” used for another character in the book. Light, as Hans Blumenberg has shown, is a complex and widely used metaphor for the arrival of knowledge, and Sartre exploits this metaphor to the fullest.<a id="fn326r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn326">15</a> Reflecting on Lucienne’s case prompts Roquentin into a free association of abject images, which lead him closer to his own illumination. “Little Lucienne was raped. Strangled. Her body still exists, her flesh bleeding. <i class="calibre1">She</i> no longer exists. Her hands. She no longer exists” (136–37). The Cartesian <i class="calibre1">cogito</i> is undone in this passage: “I am. I am, I exist, I think, therefore I am; I am because I think, why do I think? I don’t want to think any more, I am because I think that I don’t want to be, I think that I . . . because . . . ugh! I flee” (137). The passage unravels into complete absurdity: “I do not think, therefore I am a moustache” (138). The dissolution of the Cartesian subject is at the heart of Sartre’s narrative, and as I will show, it is not by chance that he chose the root as the site of this dissolution. Roquentin’s string of associations continues to stage an interpenetration of subject and object, erasing the barrier between the one who violates and the one being violated. In the case of Lucienne’s rape, one existence forces its way into another in the same way that Existence forces itself on Roquentin. Images of mud, fingers, rape, blood, bodily fluids, and “florescence of flesh” (138) lead to the culmination of the episode, an imagined rape from behind, <i class="calibre1">par derrière</i>. Anal sex means planting the sex in filth. In this instance, a penetration by force, the victim—victim because neither Lucienne nor Roquentin want the assault they receive—is surprised from behind, unable to see the coming attack. Anal violence is alluded to in other scenes. For example, in Roquentin’s dream, Maurice Barrès tells a soldier with a hole in his forehead—presumably made by a bullet—that he should put a bouquet of violets into the hole. The soldier responds, “I’m going to stick them up your ass” (83). This soldier, Roquentin, and another soldier subsequently spank Barrès until he bleeds. In another scene, the Self-Taught Man is caught trying to touch young boys in the library. He is shamed and accused of pederasty in front of everyone. Roquentin equates his own experience of being taken from behind by existence with that of Lucienne: “Existence takes my thoughts from behind and gently expands them <i class="calibre1">from behind</i>; someone takes me from behind, they force me to think from behind, therefore to be something, behind me, breathing in light bubbles of existence . . . he says he would like to faint, he <a id="p161" class="page1"></a>runs, he runs like a ferret, ‘from behind’ from behind <i class="calibre1">from behind</i>, little Lucienne assaulted from behind, violated by existence from behind” (139). The source of Roquentin’s nausea is palpable but not visible, which leads him to try out various prepositions to locate it. Where is the phenomenon located? Is it behind? Beneath? Inside? Roquentin most commonly situates it beneath the surface of the visible. Like the root, it is hidden below. He describes the root, which triggers his crisis of being, as “below explanation” (129). The insufficiency of prepositions to describe what feels at times like a spatially determined apprehension is just one example of the failure of language throughout the narrative.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">For Descartes, the root of the Tree of Philosophy was metaphysics. It is not surprising, then, that Sartre would choose the root as the site of the collapse of rational thought. The culminating scene of Sartre’s book occurs in the Jardin public, the same park Roquentin traverses regularly in his digressions through Bouville and the same park where he witnessed “le petit drame” of the man in the cloak and the little girl. The illumination is provoked by the roots of a chestnut tree. It is probably a stretch to say that Sartre thought consciously of the mandrake legend when he chose the circumstances under which Roquentin has his illumination. But its elements are all there: spilled sperm from a criminal—in this case, a pedophile and perhaps a rapist and murderer—is necessary for the mandrake to grow. Perhaps it was spilled at that very bench at the foot of which Roquentin discovers the monstrous and terrifying botanical form. The tree’s <i class="calibre1">Baumheit</i> or “treeness,” as Heidegger would call it, asserts itself as the figure for Being itself: “So I was in the park just now. The roots of the chestnut tree were sunk in the ground just under my bench. I couldn’t remember it was a root anymore. The words had vanished and with them the significance of things, their methods of use, and the feeble points of reference which men have traced on their surface. I was sitting, stooping forward, head bowed, alone in front of this black, knotty mass, entirely beastly, which frightened me. Then I had this vision” (171). The full passage illustrates the insufficiency of language, dissolving the connections between signifier, signified, and referent. Roquentin cannot recall that the root is called a root. Its label, a kind of veil that prevents one from seeing it for what it is, temporarily falls away unexpectedly as he contemplates this botanical form. The “feeble points of reference” that humans use to put objects in relation to themselves are such a given that when they dematerialize, what is left is too blunt and unbearable. Without the feeble points of reference, Roquentin is forced into a position of contemplating the verb “to be” and to acknowledge that being is the undifferentiated quality possessed by every object in the universe. His vision of being <a id="p162" class="page1"></a>is not one of neutral, cold geometries. The mounds of being he suddenly perceives are soft, disordered masses, naked and obscene. They provoke <i class="calibre1">écœurement</i>, a nauseating disgust. Sartre chooses to describe existence in terms of abject forms because abjection is the most imposing experience a subject can encounter. Through its relentless inflections, the abject refuses to be ignored. It forces the beholder to contemplate what he would like to deny: death, filth, sexual taboo, and other unsettling phenomena. Had Sartre chosen a cold, geometrical depiction of what exists, Roquentin could have perhaps remained neutral or forgotten it quickly after having noticed it. Instead, he perceives it as an assault on his senses. He sees what others cannot, and is thus all the more plagued by the menace that is invisible to everyone else. He suddenly places himself in the category of all that is “de trop,” in excess. He is superabundance in a human form. Like every object, he is too much, an irritating disruption of nothingness. Discovering that he shares the same ontological category as the revolting root, as the mud of Bouville, as someone’s ugly hands striated with veins, puts him beside himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Other philosophers took inspiration from Sartre’s jolting root scene for their own thought and writing. For example, Jacques Derrida read <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i> with “ecstatic bedazzlement.”<a id="fn327r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn327">16</a> Gaston Bachelard, who dedicates a section of his reflections on roots to Sartre’s novel, describes Roquentin’s root as “a sort of root that has lost its tree.”<a id="fn328r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn328">17</a> He notes further that Sartre refuses an ascensional depiction of the tree. He represses the tendency toward verticality, as delineated in <a class="page1" href="part0010_split_000.html#ch03">chapter 3</a> of this study. Without verticality, transcendence is impossible.<a id="fn329r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn329">18</a> For this reason in part, Sartre’s narrative does not follow the transcendent arc common to mimetic realist fiction, particularly European fiction since the nineteenth century. In a chapter entitled “Roquentin’s Nightmare,” Robert Harrison argues that what disturbs the protagonist is the root’s “begottenness,” which “aggravates the opacity of existence.”<a id="fn330r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn330">19</a> Harrison’s term “begottenness” is associated most often with procreation and the physical <a id="p163" class="page1"></a>bearing of children; one cannot forget its omnipresence in most translations of the Bible into English, in which this father begat that child in a seemingly infinite chain. “To beget” finds its French equivalent in the verb <i class="calibre1">engendrer</i>, whose Latin root <i class="calibre1">genus</i> may mean origin, birth, race, stock, descent, or kind. When a human is conceived, bodily matter coalesces from the genetic contributions of the parents and from the nourishment received from the mother. But the baby has not sprung out of nowhere. It was not pure nothingness before. The child is made up of recycled material. The begottenness feared by Roquentin is not the kind involved in baby-making. It is the much more basic fact of being itself, antecedent to the reorganizing of existing material to make new entities. His own existence, the kind owed to his parents’ copulation, is only a figure for the more imposing fact of Existence. The metaphorical opacity to which Harrison refers is a way to express that the meaning of being cannot be gotten at. For most, there is a permanent impediment to perceiving it at all, much less to interpreting it. So even if the root imposes itself on Roquentin as a suddenly seeable figure for Being, it remains ultimately indecipherable and meaningless, opaque in its fundamental insignificance. Harrison also notes that the encroaching forest that threatens the city is a <i class="calibre1">topos</i> in Western literature, and Sartre’s depiction of the botanical world in <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i> participates readily in this apprehension. The forest—“in which the fearful signs swarm,” as Derrida wrote—is where the unknown takes up residency.<a id="fn331r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn331">20</a> Roquentin writes in his journal that “once the city is dead, the vegetation will cover it,”<a id="fn332r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn332">21</a> an image that recalls the sentient vegetation responsible in part for the fall of the House of Usher in Edgar Allan Poe’s frightful tale. This fear of vegetal encroachment is evident in contemporary everyday life in the West, from the manicuring of urban botanical spaces to the availability of a vast array of weed-killers. Even Agent Orange and other herbicides used in the Vietnam War and various armed conflicts between the urbanized West and the forested East equate fear <a id="p164" class="page1"></a>with the forest and what might lurk within it.<a id="fn333r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn333">22</a> From these dire warnings in the protagonist’s journal, Harrison concludes, “Roquentin is thus condemned to the city, for the city remains the ultimate fortress of any humanism whatever.”<a id="fn334r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn334">23</a> The urban space is the last foothold of humanity in its conflict with the natural world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Sartre shares with Heidegger a discomfort with Descartes’s clean and schematic depiction of philosophy as a tree. Roquentin’s crisis must occur at the root of the tree because one objective of Sartre’s narrative is to call into question all of the assumptions and <i class="calibre1">idées reçues</i> about metaphysics. In the well-known introduction to <i class="calibre1">What Is Metaphysics?</i> [<i class="calibre1">Was ist Metaphysik?</i>], Heidegger takes Descartes to task, challenging the completeness of the latter’s “Tree of Philosophy” metaphor. Heidegger begins by citing Descartes: “Thus the whole of philosophy is like a tree: the roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches that issue from the trunk are all the other sciences.” In this same letter to his editor Picot, Descartes defined metaphysics as that which “contains the principles of knowledge/consciousness [<i class="calibre1">connaissance</i>], including the explanation of the primary attributes of God, of the immateriality of our souls, and of all the clear and simple notions that are in us.”<a id="fn335r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn335">24</a> Heidegger tries to push the metaphor further by introducing ground into the equation, suggesting that the more pertinent question involves the nature of the soil that nourishes the metaphysical roots. “What is metaphysics, viewed from its ground?,” he wonders.<a id="fn336r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn336">25</a> Heidegger is not alone here in his efforts to reground philosophy. As I show toward the end of this chapter, phenomenologists like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty also resorted to metaphors of rootedness and groundedness to describe what they felt the philosophy of their time had failed to take into account: the body as site of consciousness and the importance of subjective experience. Heidegger uses the capitalized Being to get at that quality so invisible to the human, that quality that Roquentin could not perceive until the root imposed its Being upon him and made him reckon with it. Roquentin’s revelation dramatizes the recognition of Being that Heidegger believes should act as the soil on which the tree of philosophy feeds itself. In this overwrought and almost comical application of the metaphor cited above, Heidegger <a id="p165" class="page1"></a>formulates a concept that he pursued throughout his writing years. Being and experience are “worlded”; they cannot be extracted from their context—their ground—under any circumstances. As shown in <a class="page1" href="part0011_split_000.html#ch04">chapter 4</a>, his obsession with autochthony and rootedness took many forms, from the insistence that places leave their signatures on people and cultural production to the more abstract, nearly allegorical version we see here. Despite Heidegger’s claim that Sartre misread his work, we see clear echoes between the two thinkers through their critique of Descartes and their use of the tree to stage this critique.<a id="fn337r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn337">26</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">To conclude the analysis of <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i>, it is important to note the appearance in Sartre’s narrative of Maurice Barrès, the anti-Dreyfusard from Lorraine whose nationalist, rooted politics I evaluate in <a class="page1" href="part0011_split_000.html#ch04">chapter 4</a>. He appears three times. In one particularly striking scene, Roquentin narrates a dream he had, beginning with this comical sentence: “I spanked Maurice Barrès” (83). It is no coincidence that the figure of Barrès, author of <i class="calibre1">Les déracinés</i> and a staunch defender of French regionalist essentialism, is punished by Roquentin. Yves Ansel argues: “Maurice Barrès incarnates all of the values condemned by the narrator [Roquentin]: the veneration of race and of the elite, the principle of authority, the respect for order, the glorification of military courage . . . , faithfulness to the earth, etc.”<a id="fn338r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn338">27</a> So, while Sartre uses the root primarily as a figure for the dissolution of Western metaphysics, the identity politics that haunted (and continue to haunt) France in his day are also addressed through the punishment of this polemical figure who advocated the expatriation of those who were not rooted in French soil.</p>
