      <p class="pf">The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries witnessed an obsessive, often scientifically driven search for origins or the most elementary forms of life and culture. As just a small sampling, take Darwin’s <i class="calibre1">Origin of the Species</i>, Nietzsche’s <i class="calibre1">Genealogy of Morals</i>, Jung’s work on archetypes, Heidegger’s <i class="calibre1">The Origin of the Work of Art</i>, Russell’s <i class="calibre1">History of Western Philosophy</i>, Wittgenstein’s <i class="calibre1">Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics</i>, Lévi-Strauss’s structural explorations of the origins of myths, Stephen Pepper’s research into the root metaphors or ground metaphors on which all worldviews are predicated, Foucault’s analyses of foundational power structures, and Derrida’s extensive work on the origin of writing. In the 1920s, a Belgian priest and physicist named Monseigneur Georges Lemaître developed what has become known as the Big Bang Theory, which he dubbed “la théorie de l’atome primitif” (the theory of the primeval atom). In short, the twentieth century was very much about a search for collective roots. In the twenty-first century, with the explosion of genealogical research made possible by large ancestral archives, such as the Family Search website hosted by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and by genetic testing services provided by biotech companies like 23andMe, which allow for the tracing of one’s ancestry using DNA samples, it is clear that the root quest mirrors the general inward and narcissistic turn of contemporary Western civilization.<a id="fn13r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn13">10</a> The earlier question “How did we get <a id="p20" class="page1"></a>here? Where did we come from?” has shifted, perhaps temporarily, toward a different question: “How did I get here? Where did I come from?” This search allows for the creation of a community of invisibles with whom you never have to interact.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Why do people feel such a strong connection with their ancestors? Why such pride or shame in forebears with whom you share genes and perhaps a language or a set of traditions but whom you’ll never meet? Why do adopted children sometimes feel the need to find their biologic parents? This is one of the great mysteries of our species. Humans feel reassured by ancestral continuity. When they study their ancestors, they imagine themselves to contain some kind of residual essence of the dead. If a person comes from a long line of warriors, he might believe he embodies a warrior spirit. The shameful ancestor has caused many people to change their surnames to symbolically cut ties with the disgraceful progenitor. The family tree, the schematic depiction of blood relations, has both practical and mythological functions. Its scientific iteration, the genogram, allows for the study of hereditary patterns useful in the prognostics of disease, the analysis of family dynamics, and other biologic or psychological patterns from generation to generation. But the family tree also exists as a mythologized branching of the dead into the living. Brigitte Boudon has traced the family-tree imagery from early popular legends of the tree imagined as a father or a mother through the biblical tree of Jesse and finally to its contemporary format.<a id="fn14r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn14">11</a> When the family lineage is corrupted through scandal, the death or murder of a meaningful relative, or the erasure of genealogical traces through slavery or genocide, the mourning over this corruption is frequently expressed in terms of root loss. This is clear, for example, in Paul Celan’s poem “Radix, Matrix,” which is analyzed in <a class="page1" href="part0009_split_000.html#ch02">chapter 2</a>. By giving the genealogical structure an arborescent form, the family can be imagined as an integrated whole, like a constellation that takes shape only when the human eye projects a particular configuration on a cluster of stars. The tree gives a narrative structure to blood relations, crafting a story out of arbitrary coital encounters. A certain causality is often projected onto the tree, for example in Emile Zola’s gargantuan tales of inherited vices. So the family tree can offer shade and protection, but it can <a id="p21" class="page1"></a>also be the gallows from which you hang yourself. From the etymologically connected words <i class="calibre1">genesis</i>, <i class="calibre1">genocide</i>, <i class="calibre1">genealogy</i>, <i class="calibre1">genital</i>, <i class="calibre1">genius</i>, <i class="calibre1">generation</i>, <i class="calibre1">gentle</i>, <i class="calibre1">genre</i>, <i class="calibre1">gender</i>, <i class="calibre1">gentry</i>, <i class="calibre1">genuine</i>, <i class="calibre1">gentile</i>, <i class="calibre1">gentrify</i>, <i class="calibre1">generous</i>, <i class="calibre1">gene</i>, and <i class="calibre1">genus</i>, the working lexicon of root-bound thinking begins to coalesce.</p>
