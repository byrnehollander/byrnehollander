He traveled the world, organizing peaceful protests against the Algerian War and other armed conflicts. Del Vasto wrote many books, primarily in French.</p>

He continues his assault on popular etymology: “The degree of distortion thus creates no essential differences between words maltreated by popular etymology: what they all have in common is that they are purely and simply misunderstood forms which have been reinterpreted in terms of known forms” (173). His reasoning leads him to conclude that analogy is about remembering, while popular etymology is about forgetting (174).</p>

He defines what he calls the “root-metaphor method”: “A man desiring to understand the world looks about for a clue to its comprehension. He pitches upon some area of common-sense fact and tries if he cannot understand other areas in terms of this one. This original area becomes then his basic analogy or root metaphor” (85).</p>

          <div class="blockquote">
            <p class="ntbqs">At the intersection of the semanticist’s and the antiquarian’s lines of thought one might place the procedure of a poet so learned as to have tendentially included, in his quest for elegant ambivalence, the favored key-words’ etymological meaning as one of their many splendors, but neither so well-informed as to have selected a truly up-to-date guide to word origins, nor technically expert enough to have made forceful decisions of his own in the face of erudite controversy. Paul Valéry is rumored to have been one such poet, ever in the throes of etymological anguish; if this report is correct, his hidden etymologizing would be on a par with Flaubert’s Carthaginian archeology, Rimbaud’s evocation of tropical South America (known to him solely from hearsay and readings), and Tolstoy’s logistics.</p>

          <p class="fnp">Proust’s character Brichot, a pedantic rambler, is an avid believer in the power of etymology. Of the connection between etymology and genealogy in Proust, Sarah Tribout-Joseph writes:</p>
          <div class="blockquote">
            <p class="ntbqs">The practice of genealogy is not unrelated to that of etymology. Genealogies are, more often than not, drawn up to emphasize the importance of a present person by tracing them back to an illustrious predecessor. In Proust, the importance of this two-way movement is crystallized in the stained-glass window: in the right light, the one shines through the other. We are reminded of other lines of lineage, of Jesse Trees and also of the Bible with its long lists of who begat whom. The tree can “end” in disrepute, decadence, the undermining of the noble name. Paradoxically the desire for too much purity can also be undermining, with too much inbreeding resulting in senility (let us not forget that the duc and duchesse are cousins). Saint-Loup is the only specimen of the next generation of the Guermantes that we meet and he is killed in the war. Having throughout championed the discourse on virility, the Guermantes line is in danger.</p>

          <p class="fnp">In his <i class="calibre1">Art poétique</i>, Claudel writes in a note his translation of a quote from Plato’s <i class="calibre1">Cratylus</i>: “Cratylus is right to say that natural names exist for things and that every man is not an artisan of names; only the one who considers which name is naturally suited to each thing and who knows how to reproduce the Idea of it in letters and syllables is such an artisan.” Claudel, <i class="calibre1">L’art poétique</i>, 172. George Steiner writes that “for Heidegger, the <i class="calibre1">figura etymologica</i>, the excavation of meaning from verbal roots and the history of words, is in the fullest sense an ‘emergence,’ a stepping into the light.” Steiner, <i class="calibre1">Martin Heidegger</i>, 47.</p>

What I am suggesting, however, is that the medieval reception of the Babel myth was itself part of a broader dynamic in which generation and signification are implicated in each other. Genealogy conceived along linguistic lines and language conceived along family lines represent two facets of a more general problematics of the sign prevalent in the thought of many of the most powerful intellectual figures from Augustine to the Renaissance. This connection is evident, for example, in the patristic fascination with the proximity of Adam’s engendering of Eve and his naming of her.</p>

Etymology as argument thus had great suppleness, a suspicious flexibility, and etymology as not very tightly disciplined power-play was from the beginning the scene of ideological confrontations and distrust.” Struever, “Fables of Power,” 110. Struever’s primary argument is this: “I will argue that a history of etymological practice reveals a very sharp and suggestive antinomy: analysis of the discourse of ‘classical’ etymologizing uncovers a layer of egregious narrative realism: a policy which asserts a quintessentially ‘historical’ nature of linguistic force, and the quintessentially ‘linear’ nature of social identity. But ‘modernist’ etymologizing finds this narrative fundamentalism disturbing and rejects it. I maintain that the modernist subversion of narrative fundamentalism constitutes a cession of a domain of proper investigative interest, and is a subversion, or abdication, of intellectual range and disciplinary power” (108).</p>

The story of “things” is still not quite developed on all fronts, with large areas still obscure and with the material difficult to obtain; yet we take up etymological work if it keeps the objective of this unification [between things and words] in view, and will publish work dealing purely with the history of things, even if its use for the science of words belongs only to the future. . . .

His hesitations stem in particular from the very notion that language is “rooted.” In a critique of Hans Sperber’s 1912 text “Über den Einfluss sexueller Momente auf Entstehung und Entwicklung der Sprache” (On the influence of sexual factors on the origin and development of language), Lacan challenges the metaphor of linguistic radicality and comes to the conclusion that the “notion of root is highly tenuous”:</p>
          <div class="blockquote">
            <p class="ntbqs">That words whose meaning was originally sexual spread out so as to overlay meanings that are very remote doesn’t mean as a consequence that the whole field of meaning is overlaid in that way. That doesn’t mean that all the language we use is in the end reducible to the key words it contains, words whose valorization is considerably facilitated by the fact that one accepts as proven what is, in fact, most questionable, namely, the notion of a root or a radical, and what in human language would be its constitutive link to sense. This emphasis placed on roots and radicals in languages making use of inflections raises particular problems that are far from being applicable to human language universally. What would be the case with Chinese, for example, where all the signifying units are monosyllabic? The notion of root is highly tenuous. In fact, what is involved is an illusion that is linked to the development of language, of the use of the language system, which can only seem very suspect to us.</p>

          <p class="sl"><a id="fn454" class="page1" href="part0013_split_004.html#fn454r">85</a> The appeal to the criteria of clarity and obscurity would suffice to confirm what we stated above: this entire philosophical delimitation of metaphor already lends itself to being constructed and working by “metaphors.” How could a piece of knowledge or a language be properly clear or obscure? Now, all the concepts which have operated in the definition of metaphor always have an origin and an efficacity that are themselves “metaphorical,” to use a word that this time, rigorously is no longer suitable to designate tropes that are as much defining as defined. If we went back to each term in the definition proposed by the <i class="calibre1">Poetics</i>, we could recognize in it the mark of a figure (<i class="calibre1">metaphora</i> or <i class="calibre1">epiphora</i> is also a movement of spatial translation; <i class="calibre1">eidos</i> is also a visible figure, a contour and a form, the space of an aspect or of a species; <i class="calibre1">genos</i> is also an affiliation, the base of a birth, of an origin, of a family, etc.). All that these tropes maintain and sediment in the entangling of their roots is apparent. However, the issue is not to take the function of the concept back to the etymology of the noun along a straight line. We have been attentive to the internal, systematic, and synchronic articulation of the Aristotelian concepts in order to avoid this etymologism. Nevertheless, none of their names being a conventional and arbitrary X, the historical or genealogical (let us not say etymological) tie of the signified concept to its signifier (to language) is not a reducible contingency. This implication of the defined in the definition, this abyss of metaphor will never cease to stratify itself, simultaneously widening and consolidating itself: the (artificial) light and (displaced) habitat of classical rhetoric.</p>

          <p class="sl"><a id="fn455" class="page1" href="part0013_split_004.html#fn455r">86</a> The notion that this book gives a <i class="calibre1">grounding</i> in “Derrida” should be treated with considerable caution. As its readers will discover, that which <i class="calibre1">founds</i> or <i class="calibre1">institutes</i> always imposes itself, for Derrida, more or less violently, more or less justifiably, taking possession of its ground at the price of significant exclusions and contradictions. For Derrida, too, the metaphysical tradition which bases itself on the determination of being as presence is maintained on the strength of a repression of <i class="calibre1">différance</i> as the nevertheless groundless “origin” which, in fact, constitutes that tradition’s very possibility. For Derrida, then, one must carefully consider the limits and implications of establishing one’s grounds.</p>

Above all it does not invoke a return to a prescientific or infra-philosophic form of discourse. Quite the contrary. This common root, which is not a root but the concealment of the origin and which is not common because it does not amount to the same thing except with the unmonotonous insistence of difference, this unnameable movement of <i class="calibre1">difference-itself</i>, that I have nicknamed <i class="calibre1">trace, reserve</i>, or <i class="calibre1">difference</i>, should be called writing only within the <i class="calibre1">historical</i> closure, that is to say within the limits of science and philosophy.</p>

The self of the living present is originarily a trace. The trace is not an attributable about which we could say that the self of the living present ‘is originarily’ the trace. It is necessary to think originary-being from the trace and not the trace from originary-being. This archi-writing is at work in the origin of sense.” Derrida, <i class="calibre1">Voice</i>, 73. In the English edition, the translator, Leonard Lawlor, writes that <i class="calibre1">Voice and Phenomenon</i> “contains the ‘germinal structure’ of Derrida’s entire thought” (xi). Of the final term, Derrida writes: “<i class="calibre1">Khôra</i> marks a place apart, the spacing which keeps a dissymmetrical relation to all that which, ‘in herself,’ beside or in addition to herself, seems to make a couple with her. In the couple outside of the couple, this strange mother who gives place without engendering can no longer be considered as an origin. She/it eludes all anthropo-theological schemes, all history, all revelation, and all truth. Preoriginary, <i class="calibre1">before</i> and outside of all generation, she no longer even has the meaning of a past, of a present that is past.” Derrida, “Khôra,” 124–25.</p>
