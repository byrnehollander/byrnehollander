      <p class="pf">The most focused criticism of etymologism to date was written by Jean Paulhan, an intellectual whose work was highly influential in his time but who is relatively marginal in the critical canon today. His 1953 book <i class="calibre1">La preuve par l’étymologie</i> (Proof by etymology), which has been described as an application <i class="calibre1">avant la lettre</i> of Derrida’s <i class="calibre1">Of Grammatology</i> (1967),<a id="fn442r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn442">73</a> was aimed at philosophers such as Alain (Emile Chartier), who, like many in his day, refused to acknowledge that very little difference separates an etymology from the <i class="calibre1">calembour</i>, or pun.<a id="fn443r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn443">74</a> Paulhan launches a critique against this worst of superstitions, the belief that etymology provides some kind of deeper truth about language.<a id="fn444r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn444">75</a> <a id="p201" class="page1"></a>He aims first at the assumption that words are motivated by some relationship to the physical world and that etymology allows us to trace language back to its more authentic, primordial root. Paulhan’s book targets the search for “le sens authentique” (authentic meaning) through what he called the unveiling of language, a method consisting of a meticulous reconstruction of each word’s lineage. Through a series of sarcastic examples, Paulhan pokes fun at thinkers and writers like Leibniz, Locke, Condillac, Comte, Alain, and Heidegger, those Cratylists who believe that words are not arbitrary. Even if words could be traced to their original meaning—a task he sees as impossible—his response to such success is: So what? What is to be done with an original meaning once it is found? He poses another pertinent question, “Must we believe that our ancestors were more intelligent than we?”<a id="fn445r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn445">76</a> The truth of etymology is that of simple anecdote, an unsubstantiated story that may be amusing, strange, or fascinating, but which does not actually tell us anything about language or about culture. He compares etymology to the <i class="calibre1">calembour</i>, or pun, explaining that neither of these rhetorical forms keeps its promise as an explanation about the relationship between multiple words or concepts.<a id="fn446r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn446">77</a> Etymology is not a <a id="p202" class="page1"></a>science but a rhetorical game that “justifies anything you want, without teaching us anything” (62). Paulhan’s critique aligns with my larger argument in this chapter on word roots and with my argument about rootedness in general. Belief in rootedness of any form—linguistic, genetic, geographic, cultural—shows the particular weakness of our species, which possesses the gift and curse of remembering. A person with no memory of her yesterday or of the yesterdays of her culture would not feel the need to define herself or “locate” herself in terms of her ancestors. She would have no concept of her language as a lexical heap under which purer meanings hide. She would not feel inferior to her forebears, nor would she measure her own actions by their accomplishments. Certainly, we are all the products of accumulated culture, but why should we feel obliged to measure our own legacy in terms of what must certainly be a misperception of that of our forebears? Given that even our daily assessments of our own culture are always contentious, riddled with errors and misrepresentations, how could we possibly be certain to have understood the remote roots that we lean upon so heavily to justify contemporary actions? This challenge to etymological primacy was taken up by the poststructuralists, particularly throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and it continues to play a role in contemporary French thought.<a id="fn447r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn447">78</a> For Jacques Derrida and other proponents of deconstruction, etymological play subverts the narrative that what is old is more true and that word origins can be authoritative sources for truth. Instead, he sought to show the inherent instability of language, with words at times meaning simultaneously one thing and the very opposite.<a id="fn448r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn448">79</a></p>
