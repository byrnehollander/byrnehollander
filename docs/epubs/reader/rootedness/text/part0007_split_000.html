      <p class="pf"><a class="page1"></a>In the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park, a new scale of life is given to visitors. These awe-inducing trees disregard the frame of the photograph by residing mostly outside of it. Many of them have been given names—Grizzly Giant, Faithful Couple, Bachelor and Three Graces—and their furlike bark sustains the impression that you are walking through a prehistoric landscape of quiet titans that might move at any second. Some of them have occupied the same plot of ground for three thousand years. The people who swarm at their bases, necks swiveled upward, will die before the trees do. A figure of living constancy, the same sequoia that astonished a child might impress her again when she returns to it in her retirement years. To behold the sequoias is to understand why trees have been taken up as sacred symbols in so many faiths across the planet. They resist the invisible gravitational force and act as living representatives of transcendent verticality. Something underground holds this spectacle in place.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Yet in the everyday, trees and vegetal life are nearly invisible in their less spectacular forms. You’ve likely crossed paths with them today and failed to register their presence consciously. No longer singular living entities but a green and quiet backdrop, they provide the context in which we live. Their leaves work as a seasonal clock. Their canopies give shade. They feed us, clothe us, house us. They are everywhere and thus nowhere.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">To mark the beginning of life, trees are crafted into cribs and cradles and birth certificates. In a simple lullaby, the beginning and end of a human life can be imagined through the tree:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf"><a id="p2" class="page1"></a>Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop,</p>
        <p class="sl">When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,</p>
        <p class="sl">When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,</p>
        <p class="sl">Down will come baby, cradle and all.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">In the formative years of a life, trees make books, classroom desks, and children’s blocks. We learn through them. Architects sculpt them into houses and towns, the polis where people are governed. Trees mark the end of human life when the car forgets to stay on its custom-constructed turf, as was the case for Albert Camus. They are the sites of lynchings, the fuel for the burning of witches and martyrs. They are used to build crucifixes and pine boxes. The shroud is a product of the tree. The death certificate and the last will and testament are the final, paper-thin scraps of an existence fashioned from plant life.</p>
      <p class="sec">*</p>
      <p class="pf">And what of the root? The tree is one thing, the root quite another. More literally invisible than the trunk and branches, the roots are a site of extreme figuration. It is through the root that underground life is imaginable and where attachment takes a botanical form. People often imagine themselves just as radically embedded as the plants that blanket their home region. The person is marked by his or her place. People are convinced of the solidity of their family tree and its firm rootedness in time and place. Transmission of culture moves like sap through subterranean ducts. A first set of questions: Why do humans so readily botanify themselves, insisting they are rooted—geographically and culturally—to a specific set of coordinates? Why are exile, diaspora, emigration, and expatriation described in the language of uprootedness? Why is destruction also known as eradication? Why are family histories organized in the shape of a tree, and where exactly are its roots?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Rootedness is a primary organizing trope that accommodates the need to feel connected to something outside the self; for reasons I will explain, this subterranean, botanical form seems the ideal metaphor to communicate that desire. Across cultures and through time, the root surfaces again and again as a figure for filiation, cultural connectedness, regional or national allegiance, and symbiosis with the environment. We tend to think of language as something that sprouted from an original seed and continues to burgeon. Certain kinds of knowledge are readily organized in an arborescent shape. Something in our brains is compatible with the tree’s style of proliferation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><a id="p3" class="page1"></a>It is fair to say that a large part of what is usually called the West is suffering from an overwhelming sense of rootlessness. But what is it? Simply a synonym for alienation or disconnectedness? A metaphorical way to say that people can no longer count on institutions they believed in and cannot depend on security, community structures, or even language? In any place that has been touched by large-scale displacements of people owing to war, colonization, famine, disease, or political ostracism; or where people have lost contact with ancestral memory; or where there is a general sense of isolation resulting from either new social habits or technology’s alienating effects; or where people feel estranged from the environment because of the human’s self-extraction from it, people describe themselves as uprooted. The sensation reaches far beyond the West. Is our species, the exception to so many rules, destined to live its fate of exception all alone, uprooted from nature, history, and existential serenity?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">My objective is to understand why we think about existence and dwelling in terms of rootedness. Philosophers, mystics, poets, and scientists have all, in their own ways and through their own discourses, participated in the metaphorization of person as plant. The narrative I construct here shows how the paganistic idea of human embeddedness in nature gets refashioned time and again, lyricized through literature and legitimated through politics, philosophy, and science. There is something clearly so compelling in the root as a metaphor that it has ceased to be recognized as such. Its literalization begs the question, “Was it ever figurative, or is the human actually plantlike in some verifiable way?” Among the central problems I address in this book are the overlap of nationalism and ecology, the political uses of genealogy and etymology, the literalization of metaphors, and the overwhelming sense of alienation brought about by globalization and technological modernity. In surprising ways that I will point out, the root proves to be the solution again and again for describing and addressing these problems.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When I told people that I was working on a project about roots, the first association for many of them was Alex Haley’s epic novel <i class="calibre1">Roots</i> (1976) and the subsequent film adaption (1977). This reflex to think toward Haley’s book is meaningful; his title and its subject matter—the cultural heritage transmitted from generation to generation in the context of the American slave trade—gives voice to the legacy of a population torn from its homeland and sent toward an irrevocable and tragic future, without recourse to roots as landmarks. The relationship with one’s ancestors is necessarily a problematic one. Although we didn’t know them, we feel that perhaps something more than their genetic material resides within us, something deeper and more culturally <a id="p4" class="page1"></a>consequential. The family tree, even when it is mythologized by anecdotes and stories projected onto pictures of our forebears, seems to contain unseeable truths. Our roots are where we sometimes look for explanations about our patterns of thinking and acting. We see them, perhaps erroneously, as sites for self-understanding.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As a person who left home and who plans never to return there to live, I must admit that this project is personal. In the dichotomy between <i class="calibre1">les nomades</i> and <i class="calibre1">les sédentaires</i>, I fall clearly and comfortably on the side of the nomads. And given the impact globalization has had on how we think about space, travel, property, and cultural mixity, my nomadism is congruent with the general tendency toward centrifugal living. But, in moments of homesickness, I feel prompted to interrogate my tendency toward departure while many people I know have never felt compelled to leave home. What defines the relationship a person has with home? This book is an attempt at an answer.</p>
      <p class="sec">*</p>
      <p class="pf">This formidable question could be approached in various ways. As a scholar of twentieth-century European literature and the history of ideas, I have chosen to focus on the clear epicenters of the root metaphor’s transformation during this period: France and Germany. In these two places more than anywhere else, cultural debates organized themselves around the problem of roots and radicality. The appeal for a return to or a refusal of roots surfaces constantly and in unprecedented ways, owing to the particular interplay, in those nations, of nationalism, regionalism, Catholicism, residual paganism, Graecophilia, conservatism, reformism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, technophobia, and colonialism. Twentieth-century France and Germany, at odds in countless respects, find consensus in their reliance on the solidity of rootedness as a concept, all the while customizing it to suit very specific political aims. The geographic proximity of these two countries and the richness and interconnectedness of their philosophical traditions account in part for this continuity. For example, the Cartesian schism of mind-body and culture-nature has had lasting impact in French and German thought since its conception, and these binaries surface again and again in discourses that try to mitigate rootlessness. The root metaphor, which some have argued is an archetypal image, shows its full range of volatility as it moves from biologic, positivist stylings, through nationalist, racializing discourses, to its current rhizomatic, poststructuralist treatment. One of the most fascinating recent developments in critical theory is the reintroduction of the idea that thought itself is botanical in nature and that <a id="p5" class="page1"></a>humans should look toward plants as a model for dwelling in the world, because they provide an alternate paradigm for the treatment of space, time, consumption, and death. If we take this claim as a starting point and move backward in time, it becomes clear that France and Germany are its points of origin.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The reader will notice a richer discussion of French material than German material; this is due to the plain fact that I am a specialist in twentieth- and twenty-first-century French and Francophone literature. However, the importance of Germany in any account of the conceptual problem of rootedness in Europe cannot be understated. For this reason, I must consider both places as the core sites of my claims.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This is not a project about the symbolic meanings of trees and plants or their importance as metaphors in European thought, a theme that has already received a considerable amount of attention.<a id="fn1r" class="fnref" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn1">1</a> Instead, the book focuses on roots and, more specifically, rootedness. What does rootedness mean? How does this kind of attachment differ from other kinds? How does the root differ from other metaphors for origin? What does the constant use of this metaphor say about the human’s relationship to the botanical world?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The relationship between Judaism and the trope of rootlessness is one of the most well-researched aspects of the root metaphor.<a id="fn2r" class="fnref" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn2">2</a> In addition, the identity politics stemming from the fallout of European colonialism, often borrowing metaphors of uprooting, transplantation, and vegetal invasion, have been <a id="p6" class="page1"></a>thoroughly analyzed in recent years.<a id="fn3r" class="fnref" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn3">3</a> In fact, very rich analyses of both issues, which fall under the rubric of multiculturalism, make up a large part of contemporary scholarship in twentieth-century French and German studies. While these themes return again and again in this book, I do not attempt to synthesize or make any claims about identity politics or enter into debates centered on multiculturalism. I am certain that specialists in these fields have already said more than I could hope to. Instead, my aim is to show that these iterations of the root metaphor participate in a larger pattern of the botanification of the human, which has culminated in recent studies claiming that humans and plants are connected through a complex cellular consciousness that disregards the boundaries of the body.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">An immediate challenge I encountered as I began this project was that the use of the root as a metaphor for origin, beginnings, or genealogical heritage is so widespread in the languages of focus. I found endless banal uses of it by well-known writers and thinkers throughout the twentieth century. To prevent this from becoming a theme project that would involve merely listing conspicuous appearances of the term, I have been very careful in my selection of examples. If the word <i class="calibre1">root</i> could simply be replaced by <i class="calibre1">origin</i>, I generally dismissed it. The metaphor in this petrified form is neither interesting nor telling for the arguments I attempt to make here. Instead, I have selected examples in which the root metaphor is taken up to make the case—through the rhetorical mobilization of <i class="calibre1">ethos</i>, <i class="calibre1">pathos</i>, or <i class="calibre1">logos</i>, often all three simultaneously—that something in the human is undeniably plantlike.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Another challenge was to distinguish in the examples I’ve chosen between what might be universal in the metaphorization of the root and what is specifically French or German. A preliminary comment I would make is that nationality makes the biggest difference in the philosophical, spiritual, and political deployments of the root metaphor. For example, Heidegger’s use of it is very specific to his milieu, which combines the lingering paganism of early Germanic culture, the nationally inflected belief in a superior race, and <a id="p7" class="page1"></a>right-wing land worship—what we could call “conservative conservation”—of the National Socialists. Conversely, in lyrical or ecologically minded iterations, the root metaphor takes on a more universal character. I’ve tried to treat the problem of the universal and the particular on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As is the case for any project of such magnitude, I’ve had to leave out many fascinating texts and authors. To prevent the book from resembling the tangled, vegetal proliferation it describes, it was necessary to restrict its scope, and I hope the reader will see this as a virtue. Undoubtedly, each person who reads it will think of examples from her or his own field of interest—which only attests to the significance of its claims.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">At the end of my research, I was able to make the following general observations about the root metaphor:</p>
      <div class="list">
        <p class="nlf">1. Interest in one’s roots increases in proportion to the perceived level of danger that threatens those roots. People think of themselves most as rooted when something (the foreigner, new values and technologies, forced expulsion) jeopardizes this perceived embeddedness in a culture or a place.</p>
        <p class="nl">2. The desire for rootedness is a conservative desire for comfort. Comfort here means the existential consolation of strength-giving sameness.</p>
        <p class="nl">3. Root-seeking is often symptomatic of a general sense of ecological alienation. It is the evidence of a species-wide guilt about our self-extraction from the Earth as system.</p>
        <p class="nl">4. In the Western imagination, transcendence is predicated on rootedness.</p>
        <p class="nl">5. The fear of rootlessness is the fear of decontextualization. Because the tree is both a living entity and a place, it allows for the imagining of life as a situated phenomenon. It is both contextualizing and contextualized.</p>
        <p class="nl">6. The fear of abstraction often guides a person’s search for roots. This is why celebrants of rootedness fear the future, the intellectual, digitized life, and the stranger: They are figures of the abstract, that which separates, distances, withdraws, or removes (<i class="calibre1">ab-stracts</i>) what is solid and real.</p>
        <p class="nl">7. Root logic is selective. Atavism is appealing only when the ancestor can be positively mythologized. The shameful ancestor is left in the ground.</p>
        <p class="nl">8. Proof of rootedness is necessarily impalpable. For example, the concept of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> in its mythologizing iteration sets up conditions under which land imparts some elusive difference that only the initiated can detect. Folkloric etymologists point to the primordial—and thus unprovable—origins of words as proof of some arcane connection between the world and the word.</p>
        <p class="nl"><a id="p8" class="page1"></a>9. Root-seekers are inherently retrophilic. This love of the past and the belief that it was invariably better is the product of a nostalgia for what was not necessarily experienced personally. Rootedness is a necessary metaphor in grand narratives of cultural decline.</p>
        <p class="nl">10. Because the root processes death into life, this resurrectional power allows people to imagine that an afterlife is possible, if only as a molecular transformation.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="sec">*</p>
      <p class="pf">The narrative I build in this book must begin with the subconscious underpinnings of rootedness. For this reason, the first three chapters focus on the deep structures of the root metaphor, how it works, and what it communicates about the human. I begin by showing its archetypal features, the paradigmatic ways its power as an archetype has been consolidated, and the manifold instances in which Western culture relies on the trope of rootedness. The first three chapters thus focus on the metaphoricity of the metaphor. In chapters <a class="page1" href="part0011_split_000.html#ch04">4</a> through <a class="page1" href="part0014_split_000.html#ch07">7</a>, history enters the stage. While equally invested in the way the root metaphor functions, these chapters contextualize its use by the most influential thinkers in France and Germany in the twentieth century. Organized more or less chronologically, these chapters show how the root-based mysticism and nationalism of the early twentieth century adopts the language of the rhizome by the end of the century, while still maintaining many of the same mystical elements and the same call for groundedness. If early-twentieth-century philosophers expressed a desire for human rootedness in paganistic terms, this is no less true of recent thinkers who have called for plant democracy. This book narrates the arc of attempts over the century to tweak and customize the root metaphor—typically toward political ends—all the while maintaining a strange continuity, struggling to recontextualize the human and restore the world’s lost enchantment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Laying the groundwork for the rest of the book, <a class="page1" href="part0008_split_000.html#ch01">chapter 1</a> outlines the ways in which the root has been imagined as an archetypal image. I argue that the root is an absolute metaphor, in Hans Blumenberg’s terms, emphasized particularly by his use of it in the very definition of metaphorology. I suggest that the root works as a kind of supermetaphor that has subsumed the most compelling aspects of three other metaphors for origin: the foundation, the source, and the seed. The root’s metaphorization follows a few basic patterns: root as home, root as genealogical origin, root as miniature person, root as the past, and root as a severable connection with any phenomenon, particularly the <a id="p9" class="page1"></a>environment. I claim that, in its various guises, the twentieth-century search for origins often projects a logic of filiation onto nonbiologic phenomena. Origins and transformations are described in hereditary terms as the family tree is mapped onto literary movements, etymology, philosophy, and many other fields. I show the general characteristics of a rooted conception of self as they manifest themselves in autobiography, biography, and biographical sketches of fictional characters, what I call radical portraiture. Through the observations of Carl Jung and Gaston Bachelard, I claim that the root is not only a powerful figure that represents home, the past, death, memory, and the mother; it is a figure for the subconscious itself. Its subterranean aspects and monstrous form have allowed for the proliferation of folkloric renderings, figuring prominently in the revival of the mandrake legend in twentieth-century German film. New cinematographic possibilities allow for the age-old Ovidian transformation from human to plant and vice versa to be shown with startling realism. The omnipresence of the root metaphor and the consistency of its patterns of use confirm its universal appeal; in the chapters that follow, its specificity in the context of France and Germany is analyzed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Poetry typically takes up the root for its purposes in lyrical treatments of home, longing, memory, and family. In <a class="page1" href="part0009_split_000.html#ch02">chapter 2</a>, I look at four poets—Francis Ponge, Paul Celan, Eugène Guillevic, and Denise Levertov—who have used the root to think through four distinct problems: Ponge uses it to engage critically with the question of immobility, an important characteristic that distinguishes the person from the plant; Celan uses it as a figure of the absolute negation of a generation and of a people; Guillevic sees in the root’s industriousness the starting point for a reflection on vegetal will; and Levertov appropriates it as a figure for ecological alienation. France’s botanical poet Ponge displays an ambivalence about botanical immobility, imagining plants as passive captives but also as beautifully adapted entities that have evolved in such a way that the world must come to them. Celan’s “Radix, Matrix” depicts the Shoah’s neutering effect, having cut off the generative possibilities of an entire race. The poem performs the same severing and separating gestures as the event, the matricial eradication. Guillevic, the lyrical celebrant of Breton regionalism, finds in the root’s diligence a model for humankind and projects his Leftist sympathies onto the hardworking root, the embodiment of radical trying. Finally, Levertov depicts humans who try to reroot themselves in the environment as existentially awkward beings, bereft of grace and unfit for nature. I explain how the failure of technology to cure the existential awkwardness described by Levertov is enacted in the botanical photography of Karl Blossfeldt, who tried to show that all artistic and architectural production could be traced to <a id="p10" class="page1"></a><i class="calibre1">Urformen</i>, or originary forms, in the plant world. By cutting roots out of the picture’s frame, Blossfeldt’s camera enacts the same technological severing of ties with nature that is the general condition of modernity and postmodernity. Through close readings of each poet’s handling of the root metaphor, I find that what connects them is the human’s insatiable desire for context. To live without context is to live in an existential vacuum.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In <a class="page1" href="part0010_split_000.html#ch03">chapter 3</a>, I argue that conceptions of spiritual and intellectual transcendence in European thought are predicated on rootedness. Beginning with Plato’s <i class="calibre1">Timaeus</i>, I show how the human has been imagined throughout history as rooted in the divine. The plant’s verticality is conceived as a model for moral rectitude. Paul Claudel, the father of neo-Catholicism in twentieth-century France, uses the image of the crucifix rooted in the Garden of Eden as the starting point for a series of cryptographic tableaux meant to illustrate the necessity of spiritual rootedness. His multiplication and mashing up of metaphors anticipates the maximalist, imagistic combinatorics of Deleuze and Guattari, who made their claims in <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i> and <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>, not through reason but through the accumulation of synonymous images. Aside from their fascination with the vegetal world, these three writers share a penchant for mysticism. In the following sections of <a class="page1" href="part0010_split_000.html#ch03">chapter 3</a>, I show the ways in which the inverted plant, which thrives even when uprooted and replanted upside down, has been used repeatedly as a figure for intellectually purposeful unorthodoxy (in the case of the Encyclopédistes), for intellectual risk (Paul Valéry), and for the overturning of European values (Michel Tournier). Conversion is exemplified through the plant’s unique ability to thrive with its branches in the soil and its roots in the open air. This chapter catalogs the varieties of transcendence that are possible through the root metaphor.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In <a class="page1" href="part0011_split_000.html#ch04">chapter 4</a>, I turn to the language of roots, which was in the air in the time of Simone Weil and Martin Heidegger. In the early twentieth century, the <i class="calibre1">Querelle du peuplier</i>—a debate between Maurice Barrès and André Gide, which gave voice to anti-Semitic, anti-intellectual, and anti-cosmopolitan tensions in France—had illustrated the extent to which roots were taken very literally by the more conservative thinkers of the period. From this example of French nationalism in its most reactionary form to the paganistic language used by the National Socialists for celebrating original autochthony, the appeal for a restored rootedness was everywhere. However, the two opposing worldviews that unfolded during the <i class="calibre1">Querelle</i> became synthesized in the late twentieth century, namely through concepts such as Jacques Derrida’s <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>, Edouard Glissant’s <i class="calibre1">errance enracinée</i>, Jean-Claude Charles’s <i class="calibre1">enracinerrance</i>, and Vilém Flusser’s “taking up residence in homelessness,” all of <a id="p11" class="page1"></a>which argue in favor of becoming rooted in rootlessness, embracing nomadic instability as the new default form of living. Weil and Heidegger could not have anticipated such a synthesis. The only solution they could propose for unstable Europe was the concerted effort to regrow individual and collective roots. In her book <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i>, Simone Weil’s primary objective was, I claim, the reversal of a course toward abstraction, represented for her by the capitalist worship of money, the mechanization of the means of production, the alienated worker and the <i class="calibre1">paysan</i>, Judaism and what she saw as the most abstract branch of mathematics, algebra. I juxtapose her solution for Europe’s crisis with Heidegger’s notion of a new groundedness necessary in the age of burgeoning technology. His formulation of the problem closely resembles the French term <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, which suggests that land imparts specific qualities to agricultural products. Heidegger believed this was true of people as well; they and everything they produce culturally were ideally marked by the soil. Land left its trace on (agri)culture. His introduction of a mystical element to <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> brought his arguments very close to those of Rudolf Steiner and the anthroposophists, who envisioned a new kind of integral personhood that would recontextualize humanity. I show that Weil’s anxieties about abstraction were more prescient than Heidegger’s in their anticipation of the new virtualization of our own time.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The first part of <a class="page1" href="part0012_split_000.html#ch05">chapter 5</a> discusses the lineage between Descartes’s Tree of Philosophy, whose roots are metaphysics; Heidegger’s call to attend to the soil that feeds the roots of this philosophy tree; and Sartre’s chestnut roots, which jolt the protagonist of <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i> into the stark recognition of Being. Roquentin’s apparent rhizophobia is actually a manifestation of his ontophobia, his fear of existence. In a close analysis of the novel, I show how Sartre dissolves the Cartesian subject and forces his protagonist to reckon with the fact that he shares something fundamental with the abject root: they equally exist and cannot escape existence, even through death. Sartre emphasizes the absurdity of this Being as much as Beckett did in <i class="calibre1">Waiting for Godot</i>, in which a single, contextless, and absurd tree adorns the stage. Eugène Ionesco’s very definition of the absurd emphasizes the severing of transcendental, metaphysical, and religious roots. Sartre did not choose the site of Roquentin’s crisis at random; for him, the tree had an extremely charged significance, which he communicates in his letters, diaries, and other philosophical writings. In short, he suffered from dendrophobia, the fear of trees. More broadly, the fear of vegetal life’s encroachment on human terrain runs throughout Sartre’s pages and through much of French literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, evincing a fear that all human achievement will eventually be canceled out by <a id="p12" class="page1"></a>the plant world, which far predated it. The second half of the chapter is devoted to the legacy of phenomenologists like Sartre, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, and Voegelin, who insisted that philosophy needed to reroot itself and find a new ground from which to depart. Every experience of the world is necessarily discerned through the senses and the mind of a perceiving subject. This realization led the phenomenologists to identify the perceiving subject as the starting point for all philosophical reflection. Thought is thus rooted in perception. The language of root and ground that characterizes phenomenological thought is transmitted to those poststructuralist thinkers most heavily influenced by phenomenology.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Language, whose basic morphemes are known as word roots, is imagined to grow and proliferate like a plant. In this framework, I explain in <a class="page1" href="part0013_split_000.html#ch06">chapter 6</a> how the root works as a figure of unity, the common denominator of various divergent lexical pathways. Relying on a vocabulary of the underground, of purity, and of genealogy, etymologists take as their task the retrieval of an irretrievable origin. Etymology, the often approximative search for the earliest lexical roots, became extremely politicized in twentieth-century Europe, both in its more scientific and in its folkloric iterations. As a tool of political manipulation, etymologies were often deployed to lay claim to cultural primacy, manifest, for example, in the struggle between Germanist and Romanist etymologists, who argued whether words were coined “through” Germanic culture or Latinate culture. The <i class="calibre1">Wörter und Sachen</i> movement sought to bind words to material objects, while other linguists tried to argue that the earliest syllables were experientially determined. A Cratylist revival had many arguing that words were not random, while others like Saussure argued that the relationship between sign and signifier was, in fact, arbitrary. Jean Paulhan, also skeptical of Cratylism, dedicated an entire book to discrediting those who had bought into the childish search for a mystical, primordial language. In it, he disputes the claim that the ancestors’ words were superior or more pure than their contemporary forms. Jacques Derrida challenged the idea that language is rooted and worked actively to undo the passion for origin, while Maurice Blanchot pointed out the problems with conceptualizing language as a phenomenon of filiation. Such a view, he argues, is incredibly dangerous in that it allows one to think of history in terms of a neat, linear narrative, making it provisionally manageable but leaving aside the most inconvenient, messy, and yet essential aspects of the past. I close <a class="page1" href="part0013_split_000.html#ch06">chapter 6</a> with Jean Starobinski’s proposal that we cut the imagined umbilical cord connecting ancestors and descendants. He suggests that we observe our ancestors and our contemporaries from other cultures with the same detachment, since they are aliens to us in time and space, respectively. <a id="p13" class="page1"></a>Through the example of etymology, I show that the more untraceable a root is, the more it acquires a robustness and flexibility that allows it to be harnessed politically. The gesture of exhumation implied in etymological research is in reality a form of occultation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Many have argued that the twentieth century represents a shift from a root-centered epistemology to a rhizome-centered one. In the concluding chapter, I analyze the geopoetics of Deleuze and Guattari’s writing on the rhizome and show how their antigenealogical string theory, based on the strandular instability of the rhizome, is taken up by thinkers such as Edouard Glissant and Antonio Benítez-Rojo, who sought a language for describing the Caribbean—and, more specifically, the Caribbean plantation—as an identity laboratory of cultural combinatorics. I unearth the mystical current that runs through the root metaphors of Claudel, Weil, and Heidegger, through the rhizome metaphor of Deleuze and Guattari, to recent calls for a new plant-human symbiosis, which, despite borrowing a poststructuralist vocabulary, retains many of the same paganistic arguments used by earlier thinkers. In the fields of philosophy, anthropology, and botany, recent attempts have been made to argue for a more democratic treatment of botanical life based on a natural symbiosis between plants and people. The three books of focus are Matthew Hall’s <i class="calibre1">Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany</i> (2011), Eduardo Kohn’s <i class="calibre1">How Forests Think: Toward an Anthropology beyond the Human</i> (2013), and Michael Marder’s <i class="calibre1">Plant-Thinking: A Philosophy of Vegetal Life</i> (2013). I show how a controversial precedent, <i class="calibre1">The Secret Life of Plants</i> (1973) by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, is reworked by Hall, Kohn, and Marder using the legitimating discourses of their fields. The poststructuralist inflections in these books tend toward what could be viewed as neopaganism. I close with the claim that these recent theories try to attenuate some of the alienating effects of hyperrationalization and loss of spirituality by underscoring the root’s transformation of death into life. This empirically verifiable process proves for rationalists that there is indeed an afterlife, if only a physical one.</p>
