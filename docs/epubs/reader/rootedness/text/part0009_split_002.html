      <p class="pf">We might say that Ponge is the plant’s poet; but the root has its own set of verse-makers. Paul Celan (1920–1970), the Jewish German-language poet from what was the Kingdom of Romania, today Ukraine, spent the decades between the murder of his parents Fritzi Schrager and Leo Antschel in the camps and his own suicide by drowning in the Seine attempting to say what language cannot. Celan’s fluency in Romanian, German, French, English, and Russian, and his strong competency in Hebrew and Yiddish, meant that he had at his disposal a breadth of vocabulary, grammar, and language-specific turns of phrase; this did not make easier the task of putting language to what was but is no longer. Vivian Liska has analyzed the transformation of the root metaphor in Celan’s corpus, claiming that in its early iterations, the metaphor creates a link between “poetry, blood, and soil,” which then becomes heavily encrypted in his later work.<a id="fn70r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn70">17</a> Unlike many Jewish writers and thinkers, Celan never adopts the “negative myth of origin” (56) of thriving in uprootedness, in a move that Vilém Flusser has called “taking up residence in homelessness.”<a id="fn71r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn71">18</a> Instead, Liska argues, “By excavating its own ground, Celan’s language uproots itself” (56). His neologisms and disorienting hyphenations, syntax, and rhetorical figures made his late poems some of the most difficult in the European canon.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Consider “Radix, Matrix,” published in his collection <i class="calibre1">Die Niemandsrose</i> (<i class="calibre1">No One’s Rose</i>) in 1963. This poem imparts the nonavailability of a long series of futures, personal and collective, which take nonform as the nullified vision of what might have been a family tree.<a id="fn72r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn72">19</a> John Felstiner attributes Celan’s renewed interest in Judaism around the time the poem was written to his readings of Osip Mandelstam, Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem, and other Jewish thinkers.<a id="fn73r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn73">20</a> The Judeocide recounted in the poem is both the specific, maternal <a id="p44" class="page1"></a>one and the generalized European massacre. Key words in the poem—<i class="calibre1">Heimat, Wurzel, Matrix</i>—belong to Bachelard’s catalog of images of terrestrial repose. One of the first things a reader may notice about “Radix, Matrix” is the Latinate double X in the title. X marks the spot, that place in the ground where the person and the race originated. In genetic terms, the double X is the chromosomal signature of the female. The poem’s femininity, or rather, its maternity, is signaled in the title both by the presence of the double X and by the matricial second term. Of the word “radix,” Isidore de Sevilla claimed in his <i class="calibre1">Etymologiae</i> that it derives from the spokelike <i class="calibre1">radii</i> of the root’s form.<a id="fn74r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn74">21</a> To imagine a root as a wheel just below the soil’s surface, a radial form whose lines depart from a center, is to put in conversation the collective symbolic associations of root and wheel. The root is a figure of stasis, the wheel of movement. Rootedness invokes the past; the wheel carries us toward the future, toward what Fortuna will grant or thrust upon us. The spoked <i class="calibre1">radix</i> is a botanical Wheel of Fortune. The radius is also a ray; imagine lines of light emitted from a center, a solar figure, whose form resembles the root’s reaching extremities.<a id="fn75r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn75">22</a> Celan’s root is a blacked-out sun.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The first stanza of this free-verse poem cuts words at their prefixes. The “Ver-” of “Verschwisterte,” the “Zu-” of “Zugeschleuderte,” and the “Be-” of “Begegnete” are uncoupled from their words, beginnings slit from their ends. In Celan’s first stanza, the <i class="calibre1">trait d’union</i> becomes a <i class="calibre1">trait de séparation</i>. Because this poem is about negation, lessening, lowering, and extrication, it is worth mentioning that the hyphen, of which there are nine in the poem, is also the mathematical sign for subtraction. These deverbal adjectives derived from prepositional verbs (<i class="calibre1">verschwistern, zuschleudern, begegnen</i>) turn actions into descriptions, creating the impression of induced passivity.<a id="fn76r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn76">23</a> The other hyphenated formulations are the strange pairing <i class="calibre1">Aber-Nacht</i> (literally “but-night”) and <i class="calibre1">Aber-Du</i> (literally “but-you,” in the informal second person), an equation that creates equivalency between “you” and “night.” The <i class="calibre1">aber</i>, typically a coordinating conjunction, is grammatically unifying in that it binds two equal clauses, yet adversative in its marking of a contrast between the two. <a id="p45" class="page1"></a>The use of <i class="calibre1">du</i>, which some read as an address to the mother, has also been taken as a sign of the fusion between the poem and the address. In Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe’s reading, “the poem melds with the address itself; there exists only a sort of nomination without a name, a ‘saying-you.’”<a id="fn77r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn77">24</a> Werner Hamacher sees in its address a poem that makes a specific appeal: “In asking after <i class="calibre1">radix, matrix</i>, the poem asks after its own ground. . . . It no longer speaks the language of a race or a sex, which could be the ground, center, origin, father, and mother; it speaks—deracinated, dematricated—the language of the murdered <i class="calibre1">Geschlecht</i>.”<a id="fn78r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn78">25</a> The appeal is made across an impossibly wide chasm whose blank breadth includes both space and time. The poem’s emphasis on distance comes through in the second stanza, both as a spatial (<i class="calibre1">da</i>, or “there”) and a temporal remoteness (<i class="calibre1">damals</i>, or “back then”). In fact, the “d” alliteration (<i class="calibre1">Damals, da, da, damals, da, du, den</i>) and the “a” assonance (<i class="calibre1">Acker, abschrittst, allein</i>) that mark the stanza spell <i class="calibre1">da</i>, the inversed first letters of <i class="calibre1">Aber-du</i>. John Felstiner sees in this passage a distant memory of the poet’s mother, expressed in a language that “verges on infant dada or stammering.”<a id="fn79r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn79">26</a> But it is also one of the many gestures of distancing, like the high-contrast silhouetting of the murdered <i class="calibre1">Geschlecht</i> against the sky, the impossible communication between human and stone (“Wie man zum Stein spricht”), and the vocabulary of temporal and spatial separation (<i class="calibre1">vorzeiten, da, dorthin, Hinab</i>). Readers may also notice the four colons, used typically to provide examples or to introduce an expansion or illustration of the preceding clause, which here create the effect of falling deeper into an example of an example, a <i class="calibre1">mise-en-abîme</i> downward toward the <i class="calibre1">Hinab</i>, the “down there” of the last stanza.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The sexual nature of the third stanza is extremely difficult to render in languages other than German, as Pierre Joris explained regarding his English translation of the poem. He notes that the word <i class="calibre1">Geschlecht</i> “carries a constellation of meanings: sex, gender, race, generation, family, lineage, species, genre.”<a id="fn80r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn80">27</a> While Joris translated “Rute und Hode” as the neutral “Rod and ball,” which does not necessary trigger an explicit sexual image in the Anglophone reader’s mind, he acknowledges in the introduction the sexual nature of the terms and draws a further connection between the testicle and the witness, <a id="p46" class="page1"></a>through the Latin root <i class="calibre1">testis</i>.<a id="fn81r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn81">28</a> Hamacher argues that the <i class="calibre1">Rute</i> and the <i class="calibre1">Hode</i> are rather figures for a coupling, not simply the components of male genitalia:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Rod and testicle isolate the sexual aspect of <i class="calibre1">Geschlecht</i> but not, as it might appear, its phallic aspect. For <i class="calibre1">Rute</i> is the word for the <i class="calibre1">radix</i>, which stands in Latin not only for vegetable root, for origin, source, firm ground, and soil, but also, as in <i class="calibre1">radix virilis</i> for the masculine member. <i class="calibre1">Hode</i>, on the other hand, derives from the Latin <i class="calibre1">cunnus</i>, the pudenda, and so corresponds to <i class="calibre1">matrix</i>, which just as much as <i class="calibre1">radix</i> means source, origin, and stem, but in its feminine aspect as progenitrix, womb, uterus. Only together, as <i class="calibre1">Rute</i> and <i class="calibre1">Hode</i>, and brought still closer in the asyndeton of the title, as <i class="calibre1">radix, matrix</i>: as the coupling of the masculine and feminine sexes are they “that <i class="calibre1">Geschlecht</i>, that murdered one, the one/standing black in the sky.” Only in this coupling do they fulfill the figure of immanent inversion that the erected abyss presents.<a id="fn82r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn82">29</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">The strange negative construction of the “erected abyss” depicts absence as a buildable phenomenon.<a id="fn83r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn83">30</a> But shadows have no density; the erection is only a barren profile, the silhouette of nothing. John Felstiner has argued that there is a triple pun in Celan’s choice of <i class="calibre1">Rute</i>, including one on the name Ruth, the grandmother of the biblical Jesse, father of the Israelites’ king David: “Since <i class="calibre1">Rute</i> means ‘rod’ and ‘penis,’ and in German the name Ruth is pronounced like the English ‘root,’ a triple play between languages unites—without at all reconciling—the murdered mother, the rod of miracle or anger, and a radically threatened people.”<a id="fn84r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn84">31</a> Martine Broda translates <i class="calibre1">Rute</i> into <i class="calibre1">verge</i> in French, which means the man’s generating mechanism, derived from the Latin <i class="calibre1">virga</i>, or branch. The poem abounds with the language of genetic filiation (<i class="calibre1">Matrix</i>, <a id="p47" class="page1"></a><i class="calibre1">verschwistern</i>,<a id="fn85r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn85">32</a> <i class="calibre1">Geschlecht, Rute, Hode</i>). A word that is not etymologically related but phonically similar in French is <i class="calibre1">verger</i>, the orchard, whose etymology leads back to <i class="calibre1">viridarium</i> and <i class="calibre1">viridis</i>, or green. The poem’s vocabulary is heavily botanical: <i class="calibre1">Acker</i> (field), <i class="calibre1">Wurzel</i> (root), <i class="calibre1">Fruchtboden</i> (fertile soil), and <i class="calibre1">wildblühenden</i> (wild-blooming). Fertility and greenness, <i class="calibre1">verge</i> and <i class="calibre1">verger</i>, become emptied-out ideals. In the closing stanza, Celan’s term <i class="calibre1">Fruchtboden</i><a id="fn86r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn86">33</a> conflates fruit and ground, the necessary pairing for germination to happen. All of the empty figures (<i class="calibre1">Abgrund</i>, <i class="calibre1">Nichts</i>, “o”) in “Radix, Matrix” replace the productive somethingness of fertility with naught. Derrida sees in the poem the emblematic circumcisive cutting he identifies as a feature of Celan’s poetics,<a id="fn87r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn87">34</a> but the cutting is also the neutering sort. The black silhouette of the <i class="calibre1">Geschlecht</i>, standing alone in high contrast against the sky, shows it to be the castrated shadow of its living self.<a id="fn88r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn88">35</a> The desexing of the sex culminates as an empty profile against the heavens. <i class="calibre1">Radix, Matrix</i> is a de-seeded poem.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre1">radix</i> of the title returns in the fourth stanza, de-Latinated and Germanized:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">(Wurzel.</p>
        <p class="sl">Wurzel Abrahams. Wurzel Jesse. Niemandes</p>
        <p class="sl"><a id="p48" class="page1"></a>Wurzel—o</p>
        <p class="sl">unser.)</p>
        <p class="slf">([Root.</p>
        <p class="sl">Root of Abraham. Root of Jesse. No one’s</p>
        <p class="sl">root—o</p>
        <p class="sl">ours.])</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Joris makes an effective pun when he describes this parenthetical segment of the poem as a “<i class="calibre1">parent thesis</i>.”<a id="fn89r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn89">36</a> Concentrated and cordoned off from the rest of the poem by these curved brackets, the exhausted roots are placeholders in a spot usually reserved for explanations or afterthoughts. The compressed genealogy presented here ends with no one. The anaphoric <i class="calibre1">Wurzel/Wurzel/Wurzel</i>, repeated in the same fashion as the anaphoric <i class="calibre1">du/du/du</i> in the first stanza, creates an analogy between them. If “du” is the mother, the radix-matrix binary is reaffirmed through these anaphora. The Jewish patriarch Abraham and the progenitor Jesse, father of David, are germinative figures who gave an original form to the great family tree. In a letter from his friend Nelly Sachs regarding Celan’s translation of Valéry’s <i class="calibre1">La jeune parque</i>, she wrote, “You have touched the roots of language as Abraham did the roots of faith.”<a id="fn90r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn90">37</a> In many visual renderings of Jesse, he reclines as the tree of multiplied futures sprouts from his body. This recumbent burgeoning emphasizes his role as originator, with the tree being an ideal figure to convey the Latin <i class="calibre1">oriri</i>, which means to rise or become visible, from which “origin” derives. As shown in Ponge’s formulation, the tree unfolds itself as a spectacle for the eyes, going about its forking proliferation as a singular entity or a forest, multiplying its presence. Just as the rose in the collection’s title is no one’s rose, the root is no one’s (“Niemandes/Wurzel”). The “we”—descendants of these fathers, Abraham and Jesse—will not make it outside the brackets alive. All that is ours is “o.” Broda, in her French <a id="p49" class="page1"></a>translation, renders it “o” rather than “ô,” which accommodates much more effectively readings, like Hamacher’s, that take the “o” not as simply an irrepressible interjection of sorrow and a lamentation for the hole where the root once was but as the absolute void, the absence of even the ground in which to make a hole.<a id="fn91r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn91">38</a> Celan used in many of his poems the idea of a vanishing act, a disappearance into thin air, appropriating the derisive <i class="calibre1">Luftmenschen</i> label and lyricizing it.<a id="fn92r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn92">39</a> His “Todesfuge” replaces an earthen grave with a grave in the clouds (“ein Grab in den Wolken”) or a grave in the air (“ein Grab in der Luft”), images thought to be inspired by the poem “Er,” written by a former classmate named Immanuel Weißglas, which begins, “Wir heben Gräber in die Luft” (“We raise graves in the air”). The first line of the last poem in Celan’s <i class="calibre1">Die Niemandsrose</i> reads: “In der Luft, da bleibt deine Wurzel, da, in der Luft” (“In the air, there stays your root, there, in the air”).<a id="fn93r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn93">40</a> The palindromic structure of this line, which follows the same structural logic backward and forward, leaves the root—your root—suspended permanently there in the middle of the phrase. The groundlessness of the new grave parallels the lived groundlessness of a people without a place, suspended between nations. Nicolas Berg has argued that the history of the <i class="calibre1">Luftmenschen</i> metaphor displays a “tension between an anthropologizing essentialism and a literary irony” but that the <a id="p50" class="page1"></a>“term itself says little about Jews.”<a id="fn94r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn94">41</a> He illustrates how the word <i class="calibre1">air</i>, which often has positive connotations of freedom, was transformed into a code word for detachment, danger, homelessness, and other threatening associations.<a id="fn95r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn95">42</a> Using an elemental logic, the Germans saw themselves as terrestrial stewards, while the Jews were dismissed as mere airy transients. The zero-root, a kind of botanical nothingness and interrupted fertility, is nonetheless permanent. It remains a <i class="calibre1">kleines Wurzelgetraüm</i>, the small root dream, that makes death the poet’s dwelling.<a id="fn96r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn96">43</a> Celan’s root vision is inflected with absence, matricide, and degenerated genesis, reminding us of the old unproven speculation that <i class="calibre1">race</i> and <i class="calibre1">radix</i> are etymologically connected. The root is always in proximity to death; it lives through it.</p>
