      <p class="pf">Geoffrey Gorer has argued that while Americans tend to use mechanical metaphors to describe “institutions and processes,” Europeans rely constantly on arborescent ones.<a id="fn4r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn4">1</a> In all its reductive wildness, this sweeping assessment caught the eye of the philosopher Hans Blumenberg (1920–1996) in his research for <i class="calibre1">Paradigms for a Metaphorology</i> (<i class="calibre1">Paradigmen zu einer Metaphorologie</i>, 1960). Gorer’s claim was of interest to Blumenberg because of “the methodological import of the attempt to trace stylistic differences of a <i class="calibre1">way of life</i> back to a layer of elementary ideas that always shows itself most clearly where the ‘supply of images’ has been tapped.”<a id="fn5r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn5">2</a> Even in stating the objectives of metaphorology, Blumenberg uses root language: “Metaphorology seeks to burrow down to the substructure of thought, the underground, the nutrient solution of systematic crystallizations” (5). While many have focused on the second half of this formula and its emphasis on chemical processes, the full sentence and the larger context of the quote make it clear that Blumenberg conceives of the method of metaphorology as imitative of the root’s siphoning of minerals from the soil. He proposes the notion of absolute metaphors, which “have a history in a more radical sense than concepts” (5). Blumenberg’s <a id="p16" class="page1"></a>translator Robert Savage pursues Blumenberg’s insistence on the root theme in his afterword to the book, writing, “Metaphorology radicalizes conceptual history, in the literal sense that it directs its attention to the roots of concept formation.”<a id="fn6r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn6">3</a> When Savage uses the word “literal” here, he is attempting to make a distinction between the dictionary definition of <i class="calibre1">radical</i> and its empty, contemporary meaning that leaves out its etymological connection to plant life. But “literal” here still does not refer to the literal embedded structure that feeds and stabilizes plant life. Nowhere is there a literal root in any of Blumenberg’s thought, but the metaphor is so stealthy that many fail to recognize it as one. In his methodology for the study of absolute metaphors, he argues that, in many cases, metaphors are not simply rhetorical flourishes, replaceable by nonmetaphorical language, but that they allow thoughts to be expressed that are impossible to express in nonfigurative terms. These are absolute metaphors, of which his primary example is that of light as knowledge, a <i class="calibre1">topos</i> throughout the history of Western thought. The root is clearly an absolute metaphor, a fact emphasized all the more by Blumenberg’s use of it in the very definition of the discipline of metaphorology.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The nineteenth-century British statesman Lord Palmerston argued that “half the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrives are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity.”<a id="fn7r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn7">4</a> I will show that a literalization of the metaphor of rootedness has had very real political consequences, particularly in France and Germany, the epicenters of root thinking in twentieth-century Europe. The evocation of rootedness most often signals the conservative desire for a return to the past, imagined as more stable than the present. It is also a deferral to ancestral wisdom. This root may serve as a metaphorical anchor to a geographic space, a figure for cultural transmission from one generation to the next, or even a symbol of the subconscious; its structure approximates a map of countless unexploited possibilities latent in each set of circumstances a person encounters.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">To understand in part why the root is such an effective metaphor for origin, we may compare it to three other metaphors of beginning: foundation, source, <a id="p17" class="page1"></a>and seed. The first, an architectural metaphor, portrays the beginning as a human-made structure upon which everything else is built. The ideal foundation is solid and lasting, since the house built on a shaky foundation is bound to crumble. This metaphor is often used in philosophy—for example, in the long history of debates between foundationalists and antifoundationalists—because language and ideas are easily metaphorized into architectural forms (building an idea, bridging two concepts, deconstruction, etc.). The source, an aquatic metaphor, has more spiritually inflected connotations and also refers to the truth-dispensing original text.<a id="fn8r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn8">5</a> The wellspring is the uncorrupted starting point, and although water is not itself alive, it contains and sustains life (as in the fountain of youth) and connotes purity (ablution). The seed, a compressed kernel of futurity, represents the beginning point of a vital thing; it is a figure of fertility. Compared in the New Testament to the Kingdom of Heaven, the mustard seed seems small but grows to great proportions. The root is a powerful metaphor because it groups in a single figure the primary features of the others: like the foundation, it embodies the stabilizing precondition for upward development; like the source, it is approximates water in its fluvial form and its function as a channel for fluids; and like the seed, it is a botanical figure for potential and growth. Combining the stability of architecture, the fluidity of water, and the vitality of plant life, the root is a kind of supermetaphor that subsumes the others. This flexibility manifests itself in fascinating places, for example, in its application to the seemingly oppositional categories of <i class="calibre1">jus sanguinis</i> (the right of blood) and <i class="calibre1">jus solis</i> (the right of soil). Since its founding as a republic, France moved from a conception of nationality based solely on bloodlines (<i class="calibre1">jus sanguinis</i>) to one that included birthplace (<i class="calibre1">jus soli</i>).<a id="fn9r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn9">6</a> In both cases, the fact of birth is the determining factor.<a id="fn10r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn10">7</a> The root metaphor <a id="p18" class="page1"></a>accommodates both juridical statuses: its vascular function can be compared to the genealogical transmission of <i class="calibre1">jus sanguinis</i>, and its embeddedness in the soil works effectively to represent the relationship between people and their land, as expressed through <i class="calibre1">jus soli</i>. Thus the shift from one administrative definition of nationality to the other did not require the disposal of the root metaphor. As an absolute metaphor, the root allows for the efficient saying of what is otherwise extremely difficult or even impossible to communicate. This chapter attempts to show the contours of this metaphor, which, although broad, has its limits.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only is it a particularly powerful subconscious image; I argue that it is a figure for the subconscious itself. The subliminal mind is often depicted as a subterranean network that follows a bifurcating logic rarely touched by the light of day. The root’s hidden and abject form resembles the unsayable aspects of the psyche. This living botanical thing reaches for what it needs, formulating its desires by yearning for them. It is an embodied motivation. The plant’s radical desire for what has decayed in the soil stands as a figure for memory, the reaching into dark recesses for what used to be alive. The root represents a matricial impression, an irrecuperable home where one’s character and body were still in their embryonic phases. If people think of themselves as rooted beings, it is due to an umbilical memory of an attachment to the earth, a memory that has been severed in more ways than one. Something specific about the root encourages its metaphorization as both the tenor and the vehicle, to use I. A. Richards’s distinction.<a id="fn11r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn11">8</a> For example, when roots are anchors that help the tree remain steady, they are the tenor; when people say that they are rooted in their homeland, the root is the vehicle. The smoothness of our metaphorization of this botanical form makes us often forget that it is a figure of speech; we imagine ourselves to be as rooted as the oak tree outside the window. Because of its metaphorical flexibility, the root is a favored figure of poets, who use it often in lyrical works about exile, homesickness, filiation, and the symbiosis between humans and the earth. It is alive but cannot protest our metaphorization of it. Its ugliness and subterranean dwelling make it a suitable candidate for metaphoric appropriations related to the abject, the taboo, the illicit, the underground, and, indeed, evil itself. Furthermore, with its vascular design, the root resembles the veins, nerves, and neurons in human <a id="p19" class="page1"></a>and animal bodies and the rivers and tributaries that saturate the land.<a id="fn12r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn12">9</a> As I’ll show, the application of this metaphor goes far beyond the morphological correspondence between the root and things of a similar form.</p>
