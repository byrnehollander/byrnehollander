      <p class="pf">Sartre’s choice of the root as the site of the collapse of rational thought is not arbitrary. Trees had special significance for him personally; to some extent, he feared them. In his autobiographical text <i class="calibre1">The Words</i> (<i class="calibre1">Les mots</i>),<a id="fn339r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn339">28</a> Sartre <a id="p166" class="page1"></a>recalls a story called “Wind in the Trees” (“Du vent dans les arbres”) from <i class="calibre1">Le matin</i>, which had frightened him as a child. He summarizes the plot of this story: a sick woman points through the window toward a chestnut tree that is shaking despite the absence of wind, and then she falls dead instantaneously. It is suspected that she saw an escapee from an asylum in the tree, but the truth remains concealed. Sartre refused the ending offered by the writer of the story: “According to the people of the village, it was Death that shook the branches of the chestnut tree.”<a id="fn340r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn340">29</a> Sartre writes, “I was afraid of the water, afraid of crabs and trees. Afraid of books in particular. I cursed the fiends who filled their stories with such atrocious figures. Yet I imitated them” (150–51). In a passage of <i class="calibre1">Truth and Existence</i> (<i class="calibre1">Vérité et existence</i>), he constructs a scene in which a tree is mistaken for a human being to illustrate how the mind projects identities upon the as-yet unidentified object.<a id="fn341r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn341">30</a> The eye creates a fiction in which it falsely mimes “the vision of the tree.”<a id="fn342r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn342">31</a> Clearly, the category of the arboreal is marked <a id="p167" class="page1"></a>for Sartre by the limits of knowing; it can be confused for something else, hide something, or be “misread.” The scenes of uneasiness provoked by trees are signatures of the occasional Gothic tendency of Sartre’s existentialism.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The tree was for him a site of anxiety but also a catalyst for trained attention and contemplation. Sartre recalls a piece of advice from his grandfather: “‘Ah!’ my grandfather would say, ‘it’s not enough to have eyes. You must learn to use them. Do you know what Flaubert did when de Maupassant was a little boy? He sat him down in front of a tree and gave him two hours to describe it.’ I therefore learned to see.”<a id="fn343r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn343">32</a> But in another text about Ponge’s “Le mimosa,” Sartre argues that the exercise is absurd, that when the writer looks for something in a tree, whatever he happens to find, he put there himself. His conclusions, drawn ostensibly from the tree, are in reality emanations from his own psyche.<a id="fn344r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn344">33</a> Nonetheless, as a young man, Sartre implemented this practice in his own life.<a id="fn345r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn345">34</a> The tree is an ideal locus of contemplation for several reasons. It is stationary, which means it has no possibility of escaping our gaze, but its branches and leaves can stir in the wind. This combination of stillness and movement in one entity allows for a productive consideration of both states concurrently. The tree appeals to several of our senses simultaneously: we can see it, we can hear its leaves rustling, we can smell its sap. Its leaves are samples of the transformative power of nature: the plant converts sunlight into color and energy. In its yearly life cycle, visible in the changing palette of the leaves, we see a metaphor for human life and a living sign for the progression of the seasons. Part of the tree remains unseen, which elicits thoughts of invisible phenomena and their effects. The tree is alive, as we are, but cannot look back <a id="p168" class="page1"></a>at us as we look upon it. This calls into question the ranking of forms of life: can a living thing be a subject if it doesn’t have eyes? Looking at a particular tree recalls all of the mythological botanical forms from one’s collective cultural heritage (the burning bush, Judas’s suicide tree, the woods in which the Grimms’ children are lost, the Tree of Life, Jack and the Beanstalk, Ovid’s plant-human hybrids, Newton’s apple tree). And because trees are found nearly everywhere, a thinker has easy access to a rich contemplative source at any time. In a well-known passage from <i class="calibre1">I and Thou</i>, Martin Buber articulates the rich potential of contemplating trees.<a id="fn346r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn346">35</a> He enumerates the perspectives from which one may consider this botanical entity, foreign to ourselves as subjects. Husserl, too, in a section called “Noesis and Noema” in his <i class="calibre1">Ideas</i>, uses the tree as a point of departure for reflections on perception.<a id="fn347r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn347">36</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The tree held another significance for Sartre. He took interest in this botanical life form because, according to Simone de Beauvoir, “the tree’s pointless proliferation symbolized ‘contingency.’”<a id="fn348r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn348">37</a> Yves Ansel argues the following regarding the tree, and more specifically, the root, as the site of Roquentin’s crisis: “That Sartre chooses precisely the tree to ‘indicate’ contingency does not originate in an unmotivated act: by means of the root, Roquentin interrogates and lays bare the very <i class="calibre1">grounds</i> of Western knowledge (and hence the emblematic value of the passage).”<a id="fn349r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn349">38</a> In a letter to Beauvoir, Sartre describes in detail his contemplation of a tree, considering it a cognitive exercise. He claims it was in Le Havre that he “first understood the meaning of a tree.”<a id="fn350r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn350">39</a> It is worth noting that Sartre describes this contemplated tree—a chestnut tree, no less—as a victim upon which he exhausts his “arsenal” of comparisons, whereas in <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i>, Roquentin could be seen as a victim of the tree, which forces him to see what he doesn’t want to. The imagination of the one who looks upon the tree <a id="p169" class="page1"></a>has the power to transform it into what it is not, to see behind it or around it or beneath it or to project upon it imagery that it does not yield readily on its own.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Roquentin’s contemplation of the root leads him to reflect on what he calls the “fundamental absurdity” of existence. That which is absurd is out of tune, out of joint with its context. Language fails to make sense of the fact of the root, as do logic and explanation as well. Its presence is simultaneously undeniable and inexplicable. All <i class="calibre1">being</i> things (that is, all things) partake in this absurdity by their very nature. “This root . . . existed in such a way that I could not explain it,” writes Roquentin.<a id="fn351r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn351">40</a> It remains unnameable, a quality that Samuel Beckett took up in his text <i class="calibre1">The Unnamable</i> (1953). Absurdity was an essential motif for Beckett, who placed a single tree on the stage of his famous play <i class="calibre1">Waiting for Godot</i> (1952) to disorient his characters, to give a false point of reference in a universe that offers no bearings. This tree is symbolically rootless.<a id="fn352r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn352">41</a> Despite the fact that it stands erect as though rooted in the ground, it is disconnected from any system. Everything in the blank world of the characters is incongruous. The first words readers encounter in Beckett’s <i class="calibre1">Waiting for Godot</i> are these: “A country road. A tree. Evening,” giving the semblance of a standard, contextualized dramatic setting. But the tree is a <i class="calibre1">fausse piste</i>, the wrong track toward understanding anything. When they first encounter it, Vladimir and Estragon try to use the tree as a point of orientation, because it was decided that Godot would meet them there. They are unsure whether it is the right tree, or whether it can even properly be called a tree at all. It shows a change of seasons, which gives an illusion of passing time or some kind of progression, but the stage is ultimately a closed circuit. Their world lacks signifying substance. As Michael Worton has argued, “The tree in <i class="calibre1">Godot</i> is a marvelous example of how Beckett refuses to allow concrete images to become (mere) symbols. . . . The tree thus means so <i class="calibre1">much</i> that it can have no single meaning.”<a id="fn353r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn353">42</a> To fill the hours of their waiting for a man who never arrives, they decide to do some exercises, then to imitate the bearing of a tree with erect posture and outstretched arms “for the balance.”<a id="fn354r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn354">43</a> The exercise is futile: as the stage directions indicate, both Vladimir and Estragon stagger in their attempts to hold still like the tree. They are rootless, stumbling for lack <a id="p170" class="page1"></a>of grounding. Toward the end of the second act, Estragon humbly proposes again that he and Vladimir hang themselves in the tree, a proposition already suggested in act 1. However, they abandon the plan and remain embedded in a contextless space in which real action is impossible and meaning is unattainable. It is not surprising that Ionesco defined absurdity as follows, using the root metaphor: “Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose. . . . Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless.”<a id="fn355r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn355">44</a> As Vladimir had concluded earlier in the play, “Decidedly this tree will not have been of the slightest use to us.”<a id="fn356r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn356">45</a> The absurdity of Beckett’s staged world resembles the absurdity uncovered by Roquentin.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre1">Nausea</i> is not the only place where the root plays a pivotal role in Sartre’s thought. His <i class="calibre1">Being and Nothingness</i> (1943), which is seen by many as the nonnovelistic analog of <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i>, exposes many of the novel’s themes using the language of philosophy. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the root metaphor appears here as well. In a section entitled “Doing and Having: Possession,” Sartre juxtaposes the act of sliding with a state of rootedness. He compares consciousness to the way snow organizes itself to hold up the skis of a skier who glides down the slope, providing stable support during contact and then falling back away into a soft, yielding mass. Sartre considers the relationship of the skier to the white plain as a kind of possession. This sliding is “the opposite of taking root.”<a id="fn357r" class="fnref" href="part0012_split_004.html#fn357">46</a> The kind of rootedness Sartre describes here requires a symbiosis <a id="p171" class="page1"></a>between a subject and her environment, or that which she perceives without consciousness of it. If one invests the self too deeply in one’s surroundings, one becomes inseparable from them. They are an extension of the self and, thus, virtually invisible. However, by skidding along the surface, letting things arise lightly in consciousness without bearing down upon them, the perceiving subject gets a sense of mastery over the encountered phenomena. They arrive and depart, delicate impressions left on a sentient and receptive surface.</p>
