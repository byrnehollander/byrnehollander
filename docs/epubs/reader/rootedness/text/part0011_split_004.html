The Third Republic was, so to speak, the golden age of French universalism.” Schor, “Crisis,” 47. Ernest Renan’s essay “What Is a Nation?” (1882) proposed the notion of subjective nationality, in which a person who feels aligned with the values of a certain nation elects it as her own. More recently, Alain Finkielkraut has taken up this concept in his project <i class="calibre1">Qu’est-ce que la France?</i>, a series of interviews he conducted with French thinkers on topics such as being black in France, problems of immigrant integration, forms of secularization, and Catholicism.</p>

In this last book, he writes of the “countless versions of this never-ending battle between nomads and sedentaries” (Tournier, <i class="calibre1">Mirror</i>, 37), including sedentary Cain’s murder of nomadic Abel, the territorialization of America, the Saharan Tuareg and their conflicts with settled peoples, and the Nazis’ demonization of the Jews.</p>

Until then, I’d been a patriot with the same elation as all children during wartime. The will to humiliate the defeated enemy in such a repugnant manner, which brimmed over everywhere at that time (and in the years that followed), cured me once and for all of this naïve patriotism. The humiliations inflicted by my country are more painful to me than the ones it can endure.” Weil, <i class="calibre1">Ecrits</i>, 224.</p>

Does this possibility still have any chance at all in the face of the growing “artificiality of life,” which renders easier and itself organizes that “freedom” of the masses, the arbitrary accessibility of all for all?

If you give up the past you naturally detach from the past; you lose your roots in the soil, your connection with the totem ancestors that dwell in your soil. You turn outward and drift away, and try to conquer other lands because you are exiled from your own soil.” Ibid., 73.</p>

Likewise, soul and spirit live in human bodily nature, the body created by God. If we take hold of the body’s roots—knowing that divinity lives there—and develop them correctly, surrendering to the life that is freely developing, then the soul and spirit in those roots develop, as do the inner forces of a plant, which pour from the root and develop in the warmth of sunlight.” Steiner, <i class="calibre1">Modern Art</i>, 26.</p>

As for plants, the only thought we should awaken in children is that earth and root belong together, and their only thought about blossoms should be that they are drawn from the plant by sunlight. Children are thus led out into the cosmos in a living way.” Ibid., 127. “[W]e explain how sand and stone began with what was once destined to become plant, how the earth is like one huge plant or giant tree, out of which the various plants grow like branches” (129).</p>

Similarly, in children before the change of teeth, when the bodily nature is susceptible to the soul’s influences, there are seeds of happiness and unhappiness, health and sickness, which will affect all of life until death.” Steiner, <i class="calibre1">Roots</i>, 10.</p>

We should like to take up this term; but the plant is not enough of a plant to define an intimacy with the world. A little humanity distances us from nature, a great deal of humanity brings us back. Man inhabits the earth more radically than the plant, which merely takes nourishment from it. The fable spoken by the first language of the world presupposes links that are more subtle, numerous and profound.” Levinas, <i class="calibre1">Difficult Freedom</i>, 232.</p>

Examples of the celebration of Jewish nomadism include Vilém Flusser’s “Taking Up Residence in Homelessness” and Sarah Hammerschlag’s <i class="calibre1">The Figural Jew</i>. Examples of the celebration of Jewish rootedness include most obviously all of Theodor Herzl’s texts on the establishment of a Jewish state and recent books such as Shmuel Trigano’s <i class="calibre1">Politique du peuple juif: Les Juifs, Israël et le monde</i> (Paris: Bourin, 2013); and Caryn Aviv and David Schneer’s <i class="calibre1">The New Jews: The End of the Jewish Diaspora</i> (New York: New York University Press, 2005).</p>
