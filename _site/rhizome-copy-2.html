title: Annotating the web
—</p>

<p>The <a href="https://genius.com/web-annotator">Genius Web Annotator</a> is the last product to really excite me. <span class="marginnote">I’ve included it on this blog post to demonstrate functionality – click any highlighted text on this page to get a better idea of what I mean. Or highlight text yourself, click the ‘Annotate’ button, and add your own thoughts. Please feel free to annotate this site as you read along – I’d love to hear any feedback you have.</span> This tool lets users highlight and comment on any web content. Others can then read all public annotations and even reply to them.</p>

<p>Before learning about this tool, I had been a longtime user of Rap Genius, which “breaks down text with line-by-line annotations, added and edited by anyone in the world.”<span id="side1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://genius.com/Genius-about-genius-annotated">About Genius</a></span> It was originally designed to crowdsource information from a community of hip-hop fans—those familiar with the lives and previous work of their favorite artists would unravel the mysteries of rapsmiths with their slant rhymes and unheard of wordplay. The community first expanded by annotating music in other genres—for example Sufjan Steven’s latest (and lyrically rich) indie folk album, Carrie &amp; Lowell is lovingly annotated by a group of fans<span id="side2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">The writer of this blog post is actually the number three ranked annotator on this album – check them out the annotations <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Sufjan-stevens/Carrie-lowell">here</a> and stream the album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsGODTySH0E&amp;list=PL67VKSNJdY_XBvoFECHFKyesxnDhTVM8N">here</a></span>.</p>

<p>I started using Rap Genius a few years ago and it has since raised significant funding, rebranded to “Genius”<span id="side3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/07/11/rapgenius-rebrands-with-40m-aims-to-annotate-the-world-online/">RapGenius Rebrands With $40M, Aims to ‘Annotate the World’ (Online) from <em>WSJ</em></a></span>, and settled on a more ambitious goal: <em>create an interactive guide to human culture by ‘annotating the world’</em>. Later, in July 2015, Genius released their first public API to let developers “integrate the Genius platform with websites and third-party applications”<span id="side4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/new-genius-api-provides-annotation-functionality-to-websites-and-apps/2015/06/05">New Genius API Provides Annotation Functionality to Websites and Apps from <em>ProgrammableWeb</em></a></span>. While they simultaneously released a Google Chrome extension and a bookmarklet to add annotation functionality to any website, it is only their javascript plugin (which this website is using) that enables <em>publishers</em> to natively add annotation capability to their content. While <a href="https://blog.medium.com/is-it-ok-to-highlight-your-own-stuff-fd3768dace9a">Medium</a> and other content-hosters enable highlights and in-line annotations on their content, this is the only browser-agnostic <em>and</em> framework-agnostic solution I’ve come across.</p>

<p>I find this particular aspect of the Genius annotator to be remarkable: anything can be saved, shared, commented on, and discussed without the need for any supplemental technology; you just need to include one additional line of code in your html file. While this particular implementation is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/25/11505454/news-genius-annotate-the-web-content-security-policy-vulnerability">highly flawed</a>, I find this technology incredibly exciting. In fact, so did the creators of the first widely used web browser:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Back in 1993, when Eric Bina and I were first building Mosaic, it seemed obvious to us that users would want to annotate all text on the web—our idea was that each Web page would be a launchpad for insight and debate about its own contents. So we built a feature called “group annotations” right into the browser—and it worked great—all users could comment on any page and discussions quickly ensued. Unfortunately, our implementation at that time required a server to host all the annotations, and we didn’t have the time to properly build that server, which would obviously have had to scale to enormous size. And so we dropped the entire feature.</p>
  <p class="footer">Marc Andreessen for <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/theres-a-feature-that-was-supposed-be-in-web-browsers-from-the-very-beginning-but-it-was-dropped-at-the-last-minute-2012-10"><em>Business Insider</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, the reason I chose to write about this product is because it led me on a journey. While I love the idea of annotating the web (and any online document, for that matter), almost nobody’s using a web annotator. And Genius isn’t the only company with a web annotator; it’s just the one that started things off for me. Still, none of the knowledge platforms yearning to “annotate the world” are finding a passionate user base.</p>

<p>While a lack of impactful marketing is certainly one cause, I think the core philosophy of these services is much too narrow and prescriptive. Thus, by reanalyzing the problem and proposing a novel solution, I hope to do right where Genius (and other web annotators) went wrong.</p>

<p>For example, I think the vision behind Genius is misguided: collaboratively constructing a consensus opinion and, therefore, a guide to human culture is a fool’s errand, for culture and beliefs are much too unstable to be pinned down for good. But I still think annotations can be harnessed to create a rich dialogue and thoroughly hyperlinked discussion that, I hope, will bring people closer to new ideas and perspective-challenging conversations.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think the current suite of web annotators are not social enough and insufficiently flexible for a variety of use cases. My last requirement for my computer science major is to create a non-trivial project over the course of two terms. I’ve spent the last couple weeks looking for people to work on this idea with me (we’re calling it “Notist,” an obsolete term for an annotator<span id="side3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">I must admit that this fact, and the fact that “Notist” is not yet a registered trademark are both lucky coincidences</span> and as of yesterday, we’ve just submitted our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUJJDXuQfzQaKJnsA2Nqg2lnXeibko6U6xL0rfpmros/edit?usp=drive_web">proposal</a>. I’ve been reading project management books in anticipation (<em>Napoleon on Project Management</em>; <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>; <em>The Toyota Way</em>) but I know only experience will teach me how to bring an idea from concept to execution.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Genius Web Annotator took my breath away not because it is a perfectly designed product, but because the underlying motivation for its existence opened up a new realm of possibility to me. And for this reason, I’ll always be an enthusiast of collaborative annotations, either by further pursuing Notist or contributing to like-minded open-source projects.</p>
