<p class="ct" id="ch9"><span class="epub-b">9. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari</span></p>
<p class="ep">I must speak here about two books that seem to me to be among the greatest of the great: <span class="epub-i">Difference and Repetition, The Logic of Sense.</span> Undoubtedly so great, in fact, that it is difficult to speak about them and few have done so. For a long time, I believe, this work will soar over our heads, in enigmatic resonance with that of Klossovski, another major and excessive sign. But some day, perhaps, the century will be Deleuzian.</p>
<p class="epc">—<span class="epub-i">Michel Foucault, Theatrum Philosophicum (1970, p. 885)</span></p>
<p class="linespace"> </p>
<p class="co">Gilles Deleuze, who died recently, is reputed to be one of the most important contemporary French thinkers. He has written twenty-odd books of philosophy, either alone or in collaboration with the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. In this chapter we shall analyze that part of Deleuze and Guattari’s oeuvre where they invoke terms and concepts from physics or mathematics.</p>
<p class="tx">The main characteristic of the texts quoted in this chapter is their lack of clarity. Of course, defenders of Deleuze and Guattari could retort that these texts are profound and that we have failed to understand them properly. However, on closer examination, one sees that there is a great concentration of scientific terms, employed out of context and without any apparent logic, at least if one attributes to these terms their usual scientific meanings. To be sure, Deleuze and Guattari are free to use these terms in other senses: science has no monopoly on the use of words like “chaos”, “limit” or “energy”. But, as we shall show, their writings are crammed also with highly technical terms that are not used outside of specialized scientific discourses, and for which they provide no alternative definition.</p>
<p class="tx">These texts touch on a great variety of subjects: Gödel’s theorem, the theory of transfinite cardinals, Riemannian geometry, quantum mechanics …<a href="note.html#chapter9-198" id="cha-198"><span class="epub-sup">198</span></a> But the allusions are so brief and superficial that a reader who is not already an expert in these subjects will be unable to learn anything concrete. And a specialist reader will find their statements most often meaningless, or sometimes acceptable but banal and confused.</p>
<p class="tx">We are well aware that Deleuze and Guattari’s subject is philosophy, not the popularization of science. But what philosophical function can be fulfilled by this avalanche of ill-digested scientific (and pseudo-scientific) jargon? In our opinion, the most plausible explanation is that these authors possess a vast but very superficial erudition, which they put on display in their writings.</p>
<p class="txs">Their book <span class="epub-i">What is Philosophy?</span> was a best-seller in France in 1991. One of its principal themes is the distinction between philosophy and science. According to Deleuze and Guattari, philosophy deals with “concepts”, while science deals with “functions”. Here is how they describe this contrast:</p>
<p class="ex">[T]he first difference between science and philosophy is their respective attitudes toward chaos. Chaos is defined not so much by its disorder as by the infinite speed with which every form taking shape in it vanishes. It is a void that is not a nothingness but a <span class="epub-i">virtual,</span> containing all possible particles and drawing out all possible forms, which spring up only to disappear immediately, without consistency or reference, without consequence. Chaos is an infinite speed of birth and disappearance. (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, pp. 117–118, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stnis">Let us note in passing that the word “chaos” is not being used here in its usual scientific sense (see Chapter 7 above)<a href="note.html#chapter9-199" id="cha-199"><span class="epub-sup">199</span></a>, although, later in the book, it is employed without comment also in this latter sense.<a href="note.html#chapter9-200" id="cha-200"><span class="epub-sup">200</span></a> They continue as follows:</p>
<p class="ex">Now philosophy wants to know how to retain infinite speeds while gaining consistency, by <span class="epub-i">giving the virtual a consistency specific to it.</span> The philosophical sieve, as plane of immanence that cuts through the chaos, selects infinite movements of thought and is filled with concepts formed like consistent particles going as fast as thought. Science approaches chaos in a completely different, almost opposite way: it relinquishes the infinite, infinite speed, in order to gain <span class="epub-i">a reference able to actualize the virtual.</span> By retaining the infinite, philosophy gives consistency to the virtual through concepts; by relinquishing the infinite, science gives a reference to the virtual, which actualizes it through functions. Philosophy proceeds with a plane of immanence or consistency; science with a plane of reference. In the case of science it is like a freeze-frame. It is a fantastic <span class="epub-i">slowing down,</span> and it is by slowing down that matter, as well as the scientific thought able to penetrate it with propositions, is actualized. A function is a Slow-motion. Of course, science constantly advances accelerations, not only in catalysis but in particle accelerators and expansions that move galaxies apart. However, the primordial slowing down is not for these phenomena a zero-instant with which they break but rather a condition coextensive with their whole development. To slow down is to set a limit in chaos to which all speeds are subject, so that they form a variable determined as abscissa, at the same time as the limit forms a universal constant that cannot be gone beyond (for example, a maximum degree of contraction). The first functives are therefore the limit and the variable, and reference is a relationship between values of the variable or, more profoundly, the relationship of the variable, as abscissa of speeds, with the limit. (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, pp. 118–119, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stnis">This passage contains at least a dozen scientific terms<a href="note.html#chapter9-201" id="cha-201"><span class="epub-sup">201</span></a> used without rhyme or reason, and the discourse oscillates between nonsense (“a function is a Slow-motion”) and truisms (“science constantly advances accelerations”). But what comes next is even more impressive:</p>
<p class="exi">Sometimes the constant-limit itself appears as a relationship in the whole of the universe to which all the parts are subject under a finite condition (quantity of movement, force, energy). Again, there must be systems of coordinates to which the terms of the relationship refer: this, then, is a second sense of limit, an external framing or exoreference. For these protolimits, outside all coordinates, initially generate speed abscissas on which axes will be set up that can be coordinated. A particle will have a position, an energy, a mass, and a spin value but on condition that it receives a physical existence or actuality, or that it “touches down” in trajectories that can be grasped by systems of coordinates. It is these first limits that constitute slowing down in the chaos or the threshold of suspension of the infinite, which serve as endoreference and carry out a counting: they are not relations but numbers, and the entire theory of functions depends on numbers. We refer to the speed of light, absolute zero, the quantum of action, the Big Bang: the absolute zero of temperature is minus 273.15 degrees Centigrade, the speed of light, 299,796 kilometers per second, where lengths contract to zero and clocks stop. Such limits do not apply through the empirical value that they take on solely within systems of coordinates, they act primarily as the condition of primordial slowing down that, in relation to infinity, extends over the whole scale of corresponding speeds, over their conditioned accelerations or slowing-downs. It is not only the diversity of these limits that entitles us to doubt the unitary vocation of science. In fact, each limit on its own account generates irreducible, heterogeneous systems of coordinates and imposes thresholds of discontinuity depending on the proximity or distance of the variable (for example, the distance of the galaxies). Science is haunted not by its own unity but by the plane of reference constituted by all the limits or borders through which it confronts chaos. It is these borders that give the plane its references. As for the systems of coordinates, they populate or fill out the plane of reference itself. (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, pp. 119–120)</p>
<p class="stni">With a bit of work, one can detect in this paragraph a few meaningful phrases<a href="note.html#chapter9-202" id="cha-202"><span class="epub-sup">202</span></a>, but the discourse in which they are immersed is utterly meaningless.</p>
<p class="txs">The next pages are in the same genre, and we shall refrain from boring the reader with them. Let us remark, however, that not all the invocations of scientific terminology in this book are quite so absurd. Some passages seem to address serious problems in the philosophy of science, for example:</p>
<p class="ex">As a general rule, the observer is neither inadequate nor subjective: even in quantum physics, Heisenberg’s demon does not express the impossibility of measuring both the speed and the position of a particle on the grounds of a subjective interference of the measure with the measured, but it measures exactly an objective state of affairs that leaves the respective position of two of its particles outside of the field of its actualization, the number of independent variables being reduced and the values of the coordinates having the same probability. (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, p. 129)</p>
<p class="stnis">The beginning of this text has the aura of a deep remark on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, but the end (starting with “leaves the respective position”) is totally devoid of meaning. And they continue:</p>
<p class="ex">Subjectivist interpretations of thermodynamics, relativity, and quantum physics manifest the same inadequacies. Perspectivism, or scientific relativism, is never relative to a subject: it constitutes not a relativity of truth but, on the contrary, a truth of the relative, that is to say, of variables whose cases it orders according to the values it extracts from them in its system of coordinates (here the order of conic sections is ordered according to sections of the cone whose summit is occupied by the eye). (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, pp. 129–130)</p>
<p class="stni">Again, the end of the passage is meaningless, even if the beginning alludes vaguely to the philosophy of science.<a href="note.html#chapter9-203" id="cha-203"><span class="epub-sup">203</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">Similarly, Deleuze and Guattari appear to discuss issues in the philosophy of mathematics:</p>
<p class="exi">The respective independence of variables appears in mathematics when one of them is at a higher power than the first. That is why Hegel shows that variability in the function is not confined to values that can be changed (2/3 and 4/6) or are left undetermined (<span class="epub-i">a</span> = 2<span class="epub-i">b</span>) but requires one of the variables to be at a higher power (<span class="epub-i">y</span><span class="epub-sup">2</span><span class="epub-i">/x = P</span>).<a href="note.html#chapter9-204" id="cha-204"><span class="epub-sup">204</span></a> For it is then that a relation can be directly determined as differential relation <span class="epub-i">dy/dx,</span> in which the only determination of the value of the variables is that of disappearing or being born, even though it is wrested from infinite speeds. A state of affairs or “derivative” function depends on such a relation: an operation of depotentialization has been carried out that makes possible the comparison of distinct powers starting from which a thing or a body may well develop (integration). In general, a state of affairs does not actualize a chaotic virtual without taking from it a <span class="epub-i">potential</span> that is distributed in the system of coordinates. From the virtual that it actualizes it draws a potential that it appropriates. (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, p. 122, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stnis">Here Deleuze and Guattari recycle, with a few additional inventions (<span class="epub-i">infinite speeds, chaotic virtual</span>), old ideas of Deleuze’s that originally appeared in the book Michel Foucault judged “among the greatest of the great”, <span class="epub-i">Difference and Repetition.</span> At two places in this book, Deleuze discusses classical problems in the conceptual foundations of differential and integral calculus. After the birth of this branch of mathematics in the seventeenth century through the works of Newton and Leibniz, cogent objections were raised against the use of “infinitesimal” quantities such as <span class="epub-i">dx</span> and <span class="epub-i">dy.</span><a href="note.html#chapter9-205" id="cha-205"><span class="epub-sup">205</span></a> These problems were solved by the work of d’Alembert around 1760 and Cauchy around 1820, who introduced the rigorous notion of <span class="epub-i">limit</span>—a concept that has been taught in all calculus textbooks since the middle of the nineteenth century.<a href="note.html#chapter9-206" id="cha-206"><span class="epub-sup">206</span></a> Nevertheless, Deleuze launches into a long and confused meditation on these problems, from which we shall quote just a few characteristic excerpts<a href="note.html#chapter9-207" id="cha-207"><span class="epub-sup">207</span></a>:</p>
<p class="exi"><a id="pg161"/>Must we say that vice-diction<a href="note.html#chapter9-208" id="cha-208"><span class="epub-sup">208</span></a> does not go as far as contradiction, on the grounds that it concerns only properties? In reality, the expression ‘infinitely small difference’ does indeed indicate that the difference vanishes so far as intuition is concerned. Once it finds its concept, however, it is rather intuition itself which disappears in favour of the differential relation, as is shown by saying that <span class="epub-i">dx</span> is minimal in relation to <span class="epub-i">x,</span> as <span class="epub-i">dy</span> is in relation to <span class="epub-i">y,</span> but that <span class="epub-i">dy/dx</span> is the internal qualitative relation, expressing the universal of a function independently of its particular numerical values.<a href="note.html#chapter9-209" id="cha-209"><span class="epub-sup">209</span></a> However, if this relation has no numerical determinations, it does have degrees of variation corresponding to diverse forms and equations. These degrees are themselves like the relations of the universal, and the differential relations, in this sense, are caught up in a process of reciprocal determination which translates the interdependence of the variable coefficients. But once again, <span class="epub-i">reciprocal determination</span> expresses only the first aspect of a veritable principle of reason; the second aspect is <span class="epub-i">complete determination.</span> For each degree or relation, regarded as the universal of a given function, determines the existence and distribution of distinctive points on the corresponding curve. We must take great care here not to confuse ‘complete’ with ‘completed’. The difference is that, for the equation of a curve, for example, the differential relation refers only to straight lines determined by the nature of the curve. It is already a complete determination of the object, yet it expresses only a part of the entire object, namely the part regarded as ‘derived’ (the other part, which is expressed by the so-called primitive function, can be found only by integration, which is not simply the inverse of differentiation.<a href="note.html#chapter9-210" id="cha-210"><span class="epub-sup">210</span></a> Similarly, it is integration which defines the nature of the previously determined distinctive points). That is why an object can be completely determined—<span class="epub-i">ens omni modo determinatum</span>—without, for all that, possessing the integrity which alone constitutes its actual existence. Under the double aspect of reciprocal determination and complete determination, however, it appears already as if the limit coincides with the power itself. The limit is defined by convergence. The numerical values of a function find their limit in the differential relation; the differential relations find their limit in the degrees of variation; and at each degree the distinctive points are the limits of series which are analytically continued one into the other. Not only is the differential relation the pure element of potentiality, but the limit is the power of the continuous [<span class="epub-i">puissance du continu</span>]<a href="note.html#chapter9-211" id="cha-211"><span class="epub-sup">211</span></a> as continuity is the power of these limits themselves. (Deleuze 1994, pp. 46–47, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="exis">Just as we oppose difference in itself to negativity, so we oppose <span class="epub-i">dx</span> to not-A, the symbol of difference [<span class="epub-i">Differenzphilosophie</span>] to that of contradiction. It is true that contradiction seeks its Idea on the side of the greatest difference, whereas the differential risks falling into the abyss of the infinitely small. This, however, is not the way to formulate the problem: it is a mistake to tie the value of the symbol <span class="epub-i">dx</span> to the existence of infinitesimals; but it is also a mistake to refuse it any ontological or gnoseological value in the name of a refusal of the latter.… The principle of a general differential philosophy must be the object of a rigorous exposition, and must in no way depend upon the infinitely small.<a href="note.html#chapter9-212" id="cha-212"><span class="epub-sup">212</span></a> The symbol <span class="epub-i">dx</span> appears as simultaneously undetermined, determinable and determination. Three principles which together form a sufficient reason correspond to these three aspects: a principle of determinability corresponds to the undetermined as such (<span class="epub-i">dx, dy</span>); a principle of reciprocal determination corresponds to the really determinable (<span class="epub-i">dy/dx</span>); a principle of complete determination corresponds to the effectively determined (values of <span class="epub-i">dy/dx</span>). In short, <span class="epub-i">dx</span> is the Idea—the Platonic, Leibnizian or Kantian Idea, the ‘problem’ and its being. (Deleuze 1994, pp. 170–171, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="exi">[T]he differential relation presents a third element, that of pure potentiality. Power is the form of reciprocal determination according to which variable magnitudes are taken to be functions of one another. In consequence, calculus considers only those magnitudes where at least one is of a power superior to another.<a href="note.html#chapter9-213" id="cha-213"><span class="epub-sup">213</span></a> No doubt the first act of the calculus consists in a ‘depotentialisation’ of the equation (for example, instead of 2<span class="epub-i">ax</span> – <span class="epub-i">x</span><span class="epub-sup">2</span> = <span class="epub-i">y</span><span class="epub-sup">2</span> we have <span class="epub-i">dyldx</span> = (<span class="epub-i">a – x</span>)<span class="epub-i">/y</span>). However, the analogue may be found in the two preceding figures where the disappearance of the <span class="epub-i">quantum</span> and the <span class="epub-i">quantitas</span> was the condition for the appearance of the element of quantitability, and disqualification the condition for the appearance of the element of qualitability. This time, following Lagrange’s presentation, the depotentialisation conditions pure potentiality by allowing an evolution of the function of a variable in a series constituted by the powers of <span class="epub-i">i</span> (undetermined quantity) and the coefficients of these powers (new functions of <span class="epub-i">x</span>), in such a way that the evolution function of that variable be comparable to that of the others. The pure element of potentiality appears in the first coefficient or the first derivative, the other derivatives and consequently all the terms of the series resulting from the repetition of the same operations. The whole problem, however, lies precisely in determining this first coefficient which is itself independent of <span class="epub-i">i.</span><a href="note.html#chapter9-214" id="cha-214"><span class="epub-sup">214</span></a> (Deleuze 1994, pp. 174–175, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="exis"> </p>
<p class="exi">There is thus another part of the object which is determined by actualisation. Mathematicians ask: What is this other part represented by the so-called primitive function? In this sense, integration is by no means the inverse of differen<span class="epub-i">t</span>iation<a href="note.html#chapter9-215" id="cha-215"><span class="epub-sup">215</span></a> but, rather, forms an original process of differen<span class="epub-i">c</span>iation. Whereas differentiation determines the virtual content of the Idea as problem, differenciation expresses the actualisation of this virtual and the constitution of solutions (by local integrations). Differenciation is like the second part of difference, and in order to designate the integrity or the integrality of the object we require the complex notion of differen<span class="epub-i">t</span>/<span class="epub-i">c</span>iation. (Deleuze 1994, p. 209, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">These texts contain a handful of intelligible sentences—sometimes banal, sometimes erroneous—and we have commented on some of them in the footnotes. For the rest, we leave it to the reader to judge. The bottom line is: What is the point of all these mystifications about mathematical objects that have been well understood for over 150 years?</p>
<p class="txs">Let us look briefly at the other book “among the greatest of the great”, <span class="epub-i">The Logic of Sense,</span> where one finds the following striking passage:</p>
<p class="exi">In the first place, singularities-events correspond to heterogeneous series which are organized into a system which is neither stable nor unstable, but rather “metastable,” endowed with a potential energy wherein the differences between series are distributed. (Potential energy is the energy of the pure event, whereas forms of actualization correspond to the realization of the event.) In the second place, singularities possess a process of auto-unification, always mobile and displaced to the extent that a paradoxical element traverses the series and makes them resonate, enveloping the corresponding singular points in a single aleatory point and all the emissions, all dice throws, in a single cast. In the third place, singularities or potentials haunt the surface. Everything happens at the surface in a crystal which develops only on the edges. Undoubtedly, an organism is not developed in the same manner. An organism does not cease to contract in an interior space and to expand in an exterior space—to assimilate and to externalize. But membranes are no less important, for they carry potentials and regenerate polarities. They place internal and external spaces into contact, without regard to distance. The internal and the external, depth and height, have biological value only through this topological surface of contact. Thus, even biologically, it is necessary to understand that “the deepest is the skin.” The skin has at its disposal a vital and properly superficial potential energy. And just as events do not occupy the surface but rather frequent it, superficial energy is not <span class="epub-i">localized</span> on the surface, but is rather bound to its formation and reformation. (Deleuze 1990, pp. 103–104, italics in the original)</p>
<p class="stni">Once again, this paragraph—which prefigures the style of Deleuze’s later work written in collaboration with Guattari—is stuffed with technical terms<a href="note.html#chapter9-216" id="cha-216"><span class="epub-sup">216</span></a>; but, apart from the banal observation that a cell communicates with the outside world through its membrane, it is devoid of both logic and sense.</p>
<p class="txs">To conclude, let us quote a brief excerpt from the book <span class="epub-i">Chaosmosis,</span> written by Guattari alone. This passage contains the most brilliant mélange of scientific, pseudo-scientific, and philosophical jargon that we have ever encountered; only a genius could have written it.</p>
<p class="exi">We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear signifying links or archi-writing, depending on the author, and this multireferential, multidimensional machinic catalysis. The symmetry of scale, the transversality, the pathic non-discursive character of their expansion: all these dimensions remove us from the logic of the excluded middle and reinforce us in our dismissal of the ontological binarism we criticised previously. A machinic assemblage, through its diverse components, extracts its consistency by crossing ontological thresholds, non-linear thresholds of irreversibility, ontological and phylogenetic thresholds, creative thresholds of heterogenesis and autopoiesis. The notion of scale needs to be expanded to consider fractal symmetries in ontological terms.</p>
<p class="exi">What fractal machines traverse are substantial scales. They traverse them in engendering them. But, and this should be noted, the existential ordinates that they “invent” were always already there. How can this paradox be sustained? It’s because everything becomes possible (including the recessive smoothing of time, evoked by René Thom) the moment one allows the assemblage to escape from energetico-spatiotemporal coordinates. And, here again, we need to rediscover a manner of being of Being—before, after, here and everywhere else—without being, however, identical to itself; a processual, polyphonic Being singularisable by infinitely complexifiable textures, according to the infinite speeds which animate its virtual compositions.</p>
<p class="exi">The ontological relativity advocated here is inseparable from an enunciative relativity. Knowledge of a Universe (in an astrophysical or axiological sense) is only possible through the mediation of autopoietic machines. A zone of self-belonging needs to exist somewhere for the coming into cognitive existence of any being or any modality of being. Outside of this machine/Universe coupling, beings only have the pure status of a virtual entity. And it is the same for their enunciative coordinates. The biosphere and mecanosphere, coupled on this planet, focus a point of view of space, time and energy. They trace an angle of the constitution of our galaxy. Outside of this particularised point of view, the rest of the Universe exists (in the sense that we understand existence here-below) only through the virtual existence of other autopoietic machines at the heart of other bio-mecanospheres scattered throughout the cosmos. The relativity of points of view of space, time and energy do not, for all that, absorb the real into the dream. The category of Time dissolves into cosmological reflections on the Big Bang even as the category of irreversibility is affirmed. Residual objectivity is what resists scanning by the infinite variation of points of view constitutable upon it. Imagine an autopoietic entity whose particles are constructed from galaxies. Or, conversely, a cognitivity constituted on the scale of quarks. A different panorama, another ontological consistency. The mecanosphere draws out and actualises configurations which exist amongst an infinity of others in fields of virtuality. Existential machines are at the same level as being in its intrinsic multiplicity. They are not mediated by transcendent signifiers and subsumed by a univocal ontological foundation. They are to themselves their own material of semiotic expression. Existence, as a process of deterritorialisation, is a specific inter-machinic operation which superimposes itself on the promotion of singularised existential intensities. And, I repeat, there is no generalised syntax for these deterritorialisations. Existence is not dialectical, not representable. It is hardly livable! (Guattari 1995, pp. 50–52)</p>
<p class="stx">Should the reader entertain any further doubts about the ubiquity of pseudo-scientific language in Deleuze and Guattari’s work, he or she is invited to consult, in addition to the references given in the footnotes, pages 20–24, 32, 36–42, 50, 117–133, 135–142, 151–162, 197, 202–207, and 214–217 of <span class="epub-i">What is Philosophy?</span><a href="note.html#chapter9-217" id="cha-217"><span class="epub-sup">217</span></a>, and pages 32–33, 142–143, 211–212, 251–252, 293–295, 361–365, 369–374, 389–390, 461, 469–473, and 482–490 of <span class="epub-i">A Thousand Plateaus.</span> These lists are by no means exhaustive.
