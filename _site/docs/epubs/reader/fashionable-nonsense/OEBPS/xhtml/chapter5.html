<p class="ct" id="ch5"><span class="epub-b">5. Luce Irigaray</span></p>
<p class="cos">Luce Irigaray’s writings have dealt with a wide variety of topics, ranging from psychoanalysis to linguistics to the philosophy of science. In this latter field, she maintains that</p>
<p class="ex">Every piece of knowledge is produced by subjects in a given historical context. Even if that knowledge aims to be objective, even if its techniques are designed to ensure objectivity, science always displays certain choices, certain exclusions, and these are particularly determined by the sex of the scholars involved. (Irigaray 1993, p. 204)</p>
<p class="stnis">In our opinion this thesis deserves an in-depth study. Let us look, however, at the examples Irigaray gives to illustrate it in the physical sciences:</p>
<p class="exi">This [scientific] subject today is enormously interested in acceleration that goes beyond our human powers, in weightlessness, in crossing through natural space and time, in overcoming cosmic rhythms and their regulation. He is also interested in disintegration, fission, explosion, catastrophes, etc. This reality can be confirmed from within the natural and the human sciences. (Irigaray 1993, p. 204)</p>
<p class="stnis">This catalogue of contemporary scientific work is rather arbitrary, and quite vague: what is the meaning of “acceleration that goes beyond our human powers”, “crossing through natural space and time”, or “overcoming cosmic rhythms and their regulation”? But what follows is even stranger:</p>
<p class="exi">– If the identity of the human subject is defined in the work of Freud by a <span class="epub-i">Spaltung,</span> this is also the word used for nuclear fission. Nietzsche also perceived his ego as an atomic nucleus threatened with explosion. As for Einstein, the main issue he raises, in my mind, is that, given his interest in accelerations without electromagnetic reequilibrations, he leaves us with only one hope, his God. It is true that Einstein played the violin: music helped him preserve his personal equilibrium. But what does the mighty theory of general relativity do for us except establish nuclear power plants and question our bodily inertia, that necessary condition of life?</p>
<p class="exi">– As for the astronomers, Reaves, following up on the American big bang theory, describes the origin of the universe as an explosion. How is it that this current interpretation so closely parallels the abstracts of the whole field of other scientific discoveries?</p>
<p class="exi">– René Thom, another theoretician who works at the intersection of science and philosophy, talks about catastrophes through conflicts rather than about generation through abundance, growth, positive attraction, particularly in nature.</p>
<p class="exi">– Quantum mechanics is interested in the disappearance of the world.</p>
<p class="exi">– Scientists today are working on smaller and smaller particles, which cannot be perceived but only defined thanks to sophisticated technical instruments and bundles of energy. (Irigaray 1993, pp. 204–205)</p>
<p class="stni">Let us consider these arguments one by one:</p>
<p class="tx">– About the <span class="epub-i">Spaltung,</span> Irigaray’s “logic” is truly bizarre: Does she really think that this linguistic coincidence constitutes an argument? And if so, what does it show?</p>
<p class="tx">– Concerning Nietzsche: the atomic nucleus was discovered in 1911, and nuclear fission in 1938; the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction, leading to an explosion, was studied theoretically during the late 1930s and sadly realized experimentally during the 1940s. It is thus highly improbable that Nietzsche (1844–1900) could have perceived his ego “as an atomic nucleus threatened with explosion”. (Of course, this hasn’t the slightest importance: even if Irigaray’s claim about Nietzsche were correct, what would it imply?)</p>
<p class="tx">– The expression “accelerations without electromagnetic reequilibrations” has no meaning in physics; it is entirely Irigaray’s invention. It goes without saying that Einstein could not possibly have been interested in this nonexistent subject.</p>
<p class="tx">– General relativity bears no relation to nuclear power plants; Irigaray has probably confused it with special relativity, which does apply to nuclear power plants as well as to many other things (elementary particles, atoms, stars …). The concept of inertia certainly appears in relativity theory, as it does in Newtonian mechanics; but it has nothing to do with human beings’ “bodily inertia”, whatever this is intended to mean.<a href="note.html#chapter5-133" id="cha-133"><span class="epub-sup">133</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">– In what way does the cosmological theory of the Big Bang “so closely parallel … the whole field of other scientific discoveries”? Which other discoveries, made at what time? Irigaray doesn’t say. The bottom line is that the Big Bang theory, which dates back to the late 1920s, is today supported by a plethora of astronomical observations.<a href="note.html#chapter5-134" id="cha-134"><span class="epub-sup">134</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">– It is true that in some (highly debatable) interpretations of quantum mechanics, the concept of objective reality at the atomic level is called into question, but this has nothing to do with “the disappearance of the world”. Perhaps Irigaray is alluding to cosmological theories about the end of the universe (the “Big Crunch”), but quantum mechanics does not play a major role in these theories.<a href="note.html#chapter5-135" id="cha-135"><span class="epub-sup">135</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">– Irigaray correctly observes that subatomic physics deals with particles that are too small to be directly perceived by our senses. But it is hard to see how this relates to the gender of the researchers. Is the use of instruments to extend the range of human sense perceptions a particularly “masculine” characteristic? Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin might beg to differ.</p>
<p class="stxs">Let us consider, finally, an argument put forward elsewhere by Irigaray:</p>
<p class="ex">Is <span class="epub-i">E = Mc</span><span class="epub-sup">2</span> a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest … (Irigaray 1987b, p. 110)</p>
<p class="stni">Whatever one may think about the “other speeds that are vitally necessary to us”, the fact remains that the relationship <span class="epub-i">E = Mc</span><span class="epub-sup">2</span> between energy (<span class="epub-i">E</span>) and mass (<span class="epub-i">M</span>) is experimentally verified to a high degree of precision, and it would obviously not be valid if the speed of light (<span class="epub-i">c</span>) were replaced by another speed.</p>
<p class="stx">In summary, it seems to us that the influence of cultural, ideological, and sexual factors on scientific choices—the subjects studied, the theories put forward—is an important research topic in the history of science and deserves a rigorous investigation. But, to contribute usefully to this research, one must understand at a rather deep level the scientific fields under analysis. Unfortunately, Irigaray’s claims show a superficial understanding of the subjects she addresses, and consequently bring nothing to the discussion.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Fluid Mechanics</span></p>
<p class="tnis">Some years earlier, in an essay entitled “The ‘Mechanics’ of Fluids”, Irigaray had already elaborated her critique of “masculine” physics: she seems to claim that fluid mechanics is underdeveloped relative to solid mechanics because solidity is identified (according to her) with men and fluidity with women. (But Irigaray was born in Belgium: doesn’t she know the symbol of the city of Brussels?) One of Irigaray’s American interpreters summarizes her argument as follows:</p>
<p class="ex">The privileging of solid over fluid mechanics, and indeed the inability of science to deal with turbulent flow at all, she attributes to the association of fluidity with femininity. Whereas men have sex organs that protrude and become rigid, women have openings that leak menstrual blood and vaginal fluids. Although men, too, flow on occasion—when semen is emitted, for example—this aspect of their sexuality is not emphasized. It is the rigidity of the male organ that counts, not its complicity in fluid flow. These idealizations are reinscribed in mathematics, which conceives of fluids as laminated planes and other modified solid forms. In the same way that women are erased within masculinist theories and language, existing only as not-men, so fluids have been erased from science, existing only as not-solids. From this perspective it is no wonder that science has not been able to arrive at a successful model for turbulence. The problem of turbulent flow cannot be solved because the conceptions of fluids (and of women) have been formulated so as necessarily to leave unarticulated remainders. (Hayles 1992, p. 17)</p>
<p class="stni">It seems to us that Hayles’ exegesis of Irigaray’s ideas is much clearer than the original. Nevertheless, because of the obscurity of Irigaray’s text, we cannot guarantee that Hayles has faithfully explicated Irigaray’s meaning. Hayles, for her part, rejects Irigaray’s reasoning on the grounds that it is too distant from the scientific facts (see note 137 below), but tries to arrive at similar conclusions by a different route. In our opinion, Hayles’ attempt doesn’t fare much better than Irigaray’s, but at least it is expressed more clearly.<a href="note.html#chapter5-136" id="cha-136"><span class="epub-sup">136</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">Let us now try to follow the details of Irigaray’s argument. Her essay begins as follows:</p>
<p class="exi">It is already getting around—at what rate? in what contexts? in spite of what resistances?—that women diffuse themselves according to modalities scarcely compatible with the framework of the ruling symbolics. Which doesn’t happen without causing some turbulence, we might even say some whirlwinds, that ought to be reconfined within solid walls of principle, to keep them from spreading to infinity. Otherwise they might even go so far as to disturb that third agency designated as the real—a transgression and confusion of boundaries that it is important to restore to their proper order.</p>
<p class="exi">So we shall have to turn back to “science” in order to ask it some questions. <span class="epub-b">[Footnote:</span> The reader is advised to consult some texts on solid and fluid mechanics.<a href="note.html#chapter5-137" id="cha-137"><span class="epub-sup">137</span></a>] Ask, for example, about its <span class="epub-i">historical lag in elaborating a “theory” of fluids,</span> and about the ensuing aporia even in mathematical formalization. A postponed reckoning that was eventually to be imputed to the real. [<span class="epub-b">Footnote:</span> Cf. the signification of the “real” in the writings of Jacques Lacan <span class="epub-i">(Écrits, Séminaires).</span>]</p>
<p class="exi">Now if we examine the properties of fluids, we note that this “real” may well include, and in large measure, <span class="epub-i">a physical reality</span> that continues to resist adequate symbolization and/or that signifies the powerlessness of logic to incorporate in its writing all the characteristic features of nature. And it has often been found necessary to minimize certain of these features of nature, to envisage them, and it, only in light of an ideal status, so as to keep it/them from jamming the works of the theoretical machine.</p>
<p class="exi">But what division is being perpetuated here between a language that is always subject to the postulates of ideality and an empirics that has forfeited all symbolization? And how can we fail to recognize that with respect to this caesura, to the schism that underwrites the purity of logic, language remains necessarily meta-“something”? Not simply in its articulation, in its utterance, here and now, by a subject, but because, owing to his own structure and unbeknownst to him, that “subject” is already repeating normative “judgments” on a nature that is resistant to such a transcription.</p>
<p class="exi">And how are we to prevent the very unconscious (of the) “subject” from being prorogated as such, indeed diminished in its interpretation, by a systematics that remarks [<span class="epub-i">sic</span>] a historical “inattention” to fluids? In other words: what structuration of (the) language does not maintain a <span class="epub-i">complicity of long standing between rationality and a mechanics of solids alone?</span> (Irigaray 1985a, pp. 106–107)</p>
<p class="stni">Irigaray’s claims about solid and fluid mechanics demand some comment. First of all, solid mechanics is far from being complete; it has many unsolved problems, such as the quantitative description of fractures. Secondly, fluids in equilibrium or in laminar flow are relatively well understood. Besides, we know the equations—the so-called Navier-Stokes equations—that govern the behavior of fluids in a vast number of situations. The main problem is that these nonlinear partial differential equations are very difficult to solve, in particular for turbulent flows.<a href="note.html#chapter5-138" id="cha-138"><span class="epub-sup">138</span></a> But this difficulty has nothing to do with any “powerlessness of logic” or failure of “adequate symbolization”, nor with the “structuration of (the) language”. Here Irigaray follows her (ex-)teacher Lacan, in insisting too much on the logical formalism at the expense of the physical content.</p>
<p class="txs">Irigaray continues with a bizarre mélange of fluids, psychoanalysis, and mathematical logic:</p>
<p class="exi">Certainly the emphasis has increasingly shifted from the definition of terms to the analysis of relations among terms (Frege’s theory is one example among many). This has even led to the recognition of <span class="epub-i">a semantics of incomplete beings:</span> functional symbols.</p>
<p class="exi">But, beyond the fact that the indeterminacy thus allowed in the proposition is subject to a general implication of the <span class="epub-i">formal</span> type—the variable is such only within the limits of the identity of (the) form(s) of syntax—a preponderant role is left to the <span class="epub-i">symbol of universality</span>—to the universal quantifier—whose modalities of recourse to the geometric still have to be examined.</p>
<p class="exi">Thus the “all”—of x, but also of the system—has already prescribed the “not-all” of each particular relation established, and that “all” is such only by a definition of extension that cannot get along without projection onto a given space-map, whose between(s) will be given their value(s) on the basis of punctual frames of reference.<a href="note.html#chapter5-139" id="cha-139"><span class="epub-sup">139</span></a></p>
<p class="exi">The “place” thus turns out to have been in some way planned and punctuated for the purpose of calculating each “all,” but also the “all” of the system. Unless it is allowed to extend to infinity, which rules out in advance any determination of value for either the variables or their relations.</p>
<p class="exi">But where does that place—of discourse—find its “greater-than-all” in order to be able to form(alize) itself in this way? To systematize itself? And won’t that greater than “all” come back from its denegation—from its forclusion?—in modes that are still theo-logical [<span class="epub-i">sic</span>]? Whose relation to the feminine “not-all” remains to be articulated: <span class="epub-i">God or feminine pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="exi">While she waits for these divine rediscoveries, awoman [<span class="epub-i">sic</span>] serves (only) as a <span class="epub-i">projective map</span> for the purpose of guaranteeing the totality of the system—the excess factor of its “greater than all”; she serves as <span class="epub-i">a geometric prop</span> for evaluating the “all” of the extension of each of its “concepts” including those that are still undetermined, serves as fixed and congealed <span class="epub-i">intervals</span> between their definitions in “language,” and as the possibility of <span class="epub-i">establishing individual relationships</span> among these concepts. (Irigaray 1985a, pp. 107–108)</p>
<p class="stnis">A bit farther down, Irigaray returns to fluid mechanics:</p>
<p class="exi">What is left uninterpreted in the economy of fluids—the resistances brought to bear upon solids, for example—is in the end given over to God. Overlooking the properties of <span class="epub-i">real</span> fluids—internal frictions, pressures, movements, and so on, that is, <span class="epub-i">their specific dynamics</span>—leads to giving the real back to God, as only the idealizable characteristics of fluids are included in their mathematicization.</p>
<p class="exi">Or again: considerations <span class="epub-i">of</span> pure mathematics have precluded the analysis of fluids except in terms of laminated planes, solenoid movements (of a current privileging the relation to an axis), spring-points, well-points, whirlwind-points, which have only an approximate relation to reality. Leaving some <span class="epub-i">remainder.</span> Up to <span class="epub-i">infinity:</span> the center of these “movements” corresponding to zero supposes in them an infinite speed, which is <span class="epub-i">physically unacceptable.</span> Certainly these “theoretical” fluids have enabled the technical—also mathematical—form of analysis to progress, while losing a certain relationship to <span class="epub-i">the reality of bodies in the process.</span></p>
<p class="exi"><span class="epub-i">What consequences does this have for “science” and psychoanalytic practice?</span> (Irigaray 1985a, p. 109)</p>
<p class="stni">In this passage, Irigaray shows that she does not understand the role of approximations and idealizations in science. First of all, the Navier-Stokes equations are approximations that are valid only on a macroscopic (or at least supra-atomic) scale, because they treat the fluid as a continuum and neglect its molecular structure. And since these equations are themselves very hard to solve, mathematicians try to study them first in idealized situations or through more-or-less controlled approximations. But the fact that, for example, the speed is infinite at the center of a vortex means only that the approximation ought not be taken too seriously near that point—as was obvious from the start, since the approach is in any case valid only on scales much larger than that of molecules. In any case, nothing is “given over to God”; there are, quite simply, scientific problems left for future generations.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, it is hard to see what relation, besides a purely metaphorical one, fluid mechanics could have with psychoanalysis. Suppose that tomorrow someone were to come up with a satisfactory theory of turbulence. In what way would (or should) that affect our theories of human psychology?</p>
<p class="txs">One could continue quoting Irigaray, but the reader is probably lost (so are we). She concludes her essay with some words of consolation:</p>
<p class="ex">And if, by chance, you were to have the impression of not having yet understood everything, then perhaps you would do well to leave your ears half-open for what is in such close touch with itself that it confounds your discretion. (Irigaray 1985a, p. 118)</p>
<p class="stxs">All in all, Irigaray fails to understand the nature of the physical and mathematical problems arising in fluid mechanics. Her discourse is based solely on vague analogies that, moreover, mix up the theory of real fluids with its already analogical use in psychoanalysis. Irigaray seems to be aware of this problem, as she answers it as follows:</p>
<p class="ex">And if anyone objects that the question, put this way, relies too heavily on metaphors, it is easy to reply that the question in fact impugns the privilege granted to metaphor (a quasi solid) over metonymy (which is much more closely allied to fluids). (Irigaray 1985a, pp. 109–110)</p>
<p class="stni">Alas, this reply reminds us of the old Jewish joke: “Why does a Jew always answer a question with a question?” “And why shouldn’t a Jew answer a question with a question?”</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Mathematics and Logic</span></p>
<p class="tnis">As we have seen, Irigaray has a penchant for reducing problems in the physical sciences to games of mathematical formalization or even of language. Unfortunately, her knowledge of mathematical logic is as superficial as her knowledge of physics. An illustration of this can be found in her famous essay “Is the Subject of Science Sexed?” After a rather idiosyncratic sketch of the scientific method, Irigaray goes on to write:</p>
<p class="exi">These characteristics reveal an isomorphism in man’s sexual Imaginary, an isomorphism which must remain rigorously masked. “Our subjective experiences and our beliefs can never justify any utterance,” affirms the epistemologist of the sciences.</p>
<p class="exis">You must add that all of these discoveries must be expressed in a language that is <span class="epub-i">well-written,</span> meaning <span class="epub-i">reasonable,</span> that is:</p>
<p class="bls1">– expressed in symbols or letters, interchangeable with <span class="epub-i">proper nouns,</span> that refer only to an intra-theoretical object, thus to no character or object from the real or from reality. The scholar enters into a fictional universe that is incomprehensible to those who do not participate in it.</p>
<p class="ex">(Irigaray 1985b, p. 312; Irigaray 1987a, p. 73)</p>
<p class="stni">Here again one encounters Irigaray’s misunderstandings concerning the role of mathematical formalism in science. It is not true that all the concepts of a scientific theory “refer only to an intra-theoretical object”. Quite the contrary, at least <span class="epub-i">some</span> of the theory’s concepts must correspond to something in the real world, for otherwise the theory would have no empirical consequences whatsoever (and thus not be scientific). Consequently, the scientist’s universe is not populated solely by fictions. Finally, neither the real world nor the scientific theories that explain it are completely incomprehensible to non-experts; in many cases, there exist good popular or semi-popular expositions.</p>
<p class="txs">The remainder of Irigaray’s text is both pedantic and unwittingly comic:</p>
<p class="nl">– the formative signs for terms and for predicates are:</p>
<p class="nsl">+ : or definition of a new term<a href="note.html#chapter5-140" id="cha-140"><span class="epub-sup">140</span></a>;</p>
<p class="nsl">= : which indicates a property by equivalence and substitution (belonging to a whole or to a world);</p>
<p class="nsl">∈ : signifying belonging to an object type</p>
<p class="nl">– the <span class="epub-i">quantifiers</span> (and not <span class="epub-i">qualifiers)</span> are:<br/>≥ ≤;<br/>the universal quantifier;<br/>the existential quantifier submitted, as its name indicates, to the quantitative.<br/>    According to the semantics of incomplete beings (Frege), functional symbols are variables found at the boundary of the identity of syntactic forms and the dominant role is given to the universality symbol or universal quantifier.</p>
<p class="nl">– the <span class="epub-i">connectors</span> are:</p>
<p class="nssl">- negation: P or not P<a href="note.html#chapter5-141" id="cha-141"><span class="epub-sup">141</span></a>;</p>
<p class="nssl">- conjunction: P or Q<a href="note.html#chapter5-142" id="cha-142"><span class="epub-sup">142</span></a>;</p>
<p class="nssl">- disjunction: P or Q;</p>
<p class="nssl">- implication: P implies Q;</p>
<p class="nssl">- equivalence: P equals Q;</p>
<p class="nsl">There is then no sign:</p>
<p class="nssl">- of <span class="epub-i">difference</span> other than the quantitative;</p>
<p class="nssl">- of <span class="epub-i">reciprocity</span> (other than within a common property or a common whole);</p>
<p class="nssl">- of <span class="epub-i">exchange;</span></p>
<p class="nssl">- of <span class="epub-i">fluidity.</span></p>
<p class="nl">(Irigaray 1985b, pp. 312–313; Irigaray 1987a, pp. 73–74)</p>
<p class="stx">To begin with, Irigaray has confused the concept of “quantification” in logic with the word’s everyday meaning (i.e., making something quantitative or numerical); in actual fact, there is no relationship between these two concepts. The quantifiers in logic are “for all” (universal quantifier) and “there exists” (existential quantifier). For example, the sentence <span class="epub-i">“x</span> likes chocolate” is a statement about a certain individual <span class="epub-i">x;</span> the universal quantifier transforms it into the statement “for all <span class="epub-i">x</span> [belonging to some set assumed known], <span class="epub-i">x</span> likes chocolate”, while the existential quantifier transforms it into “there exists at least one <span class="epub-i">x</span> [belonging to some set assumed known] such that <span class="epub-i">x</span> likes chocolate”. This clearly has nothing to do with numbers, and Irigaray’s purported opposition between “quantifiers” and “qualifiers” is meaningless.</p>
<p class="tx">Besides, the inequality signs “≥” (greater than or equal to) and “≤” (less than or equal to) are not quantifiers. They relate to quantification in the ordinary sense of the word, not in the sense of quantifiers in logic.</p>
<p class="tx">Moreover, no “dominant role” is granted to the universal quantifier. Quite the contrary, there is a perfect symmetry between the universal and existential quantifiers, and any proposition using one of them can be transformed into a logically equivalent proposition using the other (at least in classical logic, which is Irigaray’s supposed subject).<a href="note.html#chapter5-143" id="cha-143"><span class="epub-sup">143</span></a> This is an elementary fact, taught in every introductory logic course; it is surprising that Irigaray, who speaks so much about mathematical logic, should fail to know it.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, her assertion that there is no sign (or, what is more relevant, no <span class="epub-i">concept)</span> of difference other than the quantitative is false. In mathematics, there are many types of objects other than numbers—for example, sets, functions, groups, topological spaces, etc.—and, when talking about two such objects, one may of course say that they are identical or different. The standard equality sign (=) is used to indicate that they are identical, and the standard inequality sign (≠) to indicate that they are different.</p>
<p class="txs">Later in the same essay, Irigaray claims to unmask also the sexist biases at the heart of “pure” mathematics:</p>
<p class="ex">- the <span class="epub-i">mathematical sciences,</span> in the theory of wholes [<span class="epub-i">théorie des ensembles</span>], concern themselves with closed and open spaces, with the infinitely big and the infinitely small.<a href="note.html#chapter5-144" id="cha-144"><span class="epub-sup">144</span></a> They concern themselves very little with the question of the partially open, with wholes that are not clearly delineated [<span class="epub-i">ensembles flous</span>], with any analysis of the problem of borders [<span class="epub-i">bords</span>], of the passage between, of fluctuations occurring between the thresholds of specific wholes. Even if topology suggests these questions, it emphasizes what closes rather than what resists all circularity. (Irigaray 1985b, p. 315; Irigaray 1987a, pp. 76–77<a href="note.html#chapter5-145" id="cha-145"><span class="epub-sup">145</span></a>)</p>
<p class="stni">Irigaray’s phrases are vague: “the partially open”, “the passage between”, “fluctuations between the thresholds of specific wholes”—what exactly is she talking about? For what it’s worth, the “problem” of boundaries [<span class="epub-i">bords</span>], far from being neglected, has been at the center of algebraic topology since its inception a century ago<a href="note.html#chapter5-146" id="cha-146"><span class="epub-sup">146</span></a>, and “manifolds with boundary” [<span class="epub-i">variétés à bord</span>] have been actively studied in differential geometry for at least fifty years. And, last but not least, what does all this have to do with feminism?</p>
<p class="txs">We were therefore quite surprised to find this passage quoted in a recent book devoted to the teaching of mathematics. The author is a prominent American feminist pedagogue of mathematics, whose goal—which we share wholeheartedly—is to attract more young women to scientific careers. She quotes approvingly this text of Irigaray and continues by saying:</p>
<p class="ex">In the context provided by Irigaray we can see an opposition between the linear time of mathematics problems of related rates, distance formulas, and linear acceleration versus the dominant experiential cyclical time of the menstrual body. Is it obvious to the female mind-body that intervals have end-points, that parabolas neatly divide the plane, and, indeed, that the linear mathematics of schooling describes the world of experience in intuitively obvious ways?<a href="note.html#chapter5-147" id="cha-147"><span class="epub-sup">147</span></a> (Damarin 1995, p. 252)</p>
<p class="stni">This theory is startling, to say the least: Does the author really believe that menstruation makes it more difficult for young women to understand elementary notions of geometry? This view is uncannily reminiscent of the Victorian gentlemen who held that women, with their delicate reproductive organs, are unsuited to rational thought and to science. With friends like these, the feminist cause hardly needs enemies.<a href="note.html#chapter5-148" id="cha-148"><span class="epub-sup">148</span></a></p>
<p class="txs">One finds similar ideas in Irigaray’s own writings. Indeed, her scientific confusions are linked to, and are taken to provide support for, more general philosophical considerations of a vaguely relativist nature. Starting from the idea that science is “masculine”, Irigaray rejects “the belief in a truth independent of the subject” [<span class="epub-i">la croyance en une vérité indépendante du sujet</span>] and advises women not to</p>
<p class="ex">accept or subscribe to the existence of a neutral, universal science, to which women should painfully gain access and with which they then torture themselves and taunt other women, transforming science into a new superego. (Irigaray 1993, p. 203)</p>
<p class="stni">These claims are clearly very debatable. To be sure, they are accompanied by more nuanced assertions, for example: “Truth is always the product of some man or woman. This does not mean that truth contains no objectivity”; and “All truth is partially relative.”<a href="note.html#chapter5-149" id="cha-149"><span class="epub-sup">149</span></a> The problem is to know exactly what Irigaray wants to say and how she intends to resolve these contradictions.</p>
<p class="txs">The roots of the tree of science may be bitter, but its fruits are sweet. To say that women should shun a universal science amounts to infantilizing them. To link rationality and objectivity to the male, and emotion and subjectivity to the female, is to repeat the most blatant sexist stereotypes. Speaking of the female “sexual economy” from puberty through menopause, Irigaray writes:</p>
<p class="ex">But every stage in this development has its own temporality, which is possibly cyclic and linked to cosmic rhythms. If women have felt so terribly threatened by the accident at Chernobyl, that is because of the irreducible relation of their bodies to the universe. (Irigaray 1993, p. 200)<a href="note.html#chapter5-150" id="cha-150"><span class="epub-sup">150</span></a></p>
<p class="stni">Here Irigaray falls straight into mysticism. Cosmic rhythms, relation to the universe—what on earth is she talking about? To reduce women to their sexuality, menstrual cycles, and rhythms (cosmic or not) is to attack everything the feminist movement has fought for during the last three decades. Simone de Beauvoir must be turning in her grave.</p>
