<p class="fst" id="pr">Additional praise for <span class="epub-i">Fashionable Nonsense</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“Sokal is trying to stake out a territory free from the political claims of culture.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—Edward Rothstein, <span class="epub-i">The New York Times</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“The modern sciences are among the most remarkable of human achievements and cultural treasures. Like others, they merit—and reward—respectful and scrupulous engagement. Sokal and Bricmont show how easily such truisms can recede from view, and how harmful the consequences can be for intellectual life and human affairs. They also provide a thoughtful and constructive critical analysis of fundamental issues of empirical inquiry. It is a timely and substantial contribution.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—Noam Chomsky</p>
<p class="fsq">“A brilliant and entertaining book … <span class="epub-i">Fashionable Nonsense</span> exposes the fraud.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—<span class="epub-i">The Advocate</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“A debut that promises to be [the debate’s] most explosive incarnation yet.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—Kristina Zarlengo, <span class="epub-i">Salon Magazine</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“Sheer chutzpah and cleverness … The book is a sobering catalog of idiocies by some of those claimed to be the best thinkers of our times … I recommend this book.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—Russell Jacoby, <span class="epub-i">Los Angeles Weekly</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“[An] important and well-documented book … Every passage is followed by the authors’ often humorous debunking of the writers’ garbled science and obscure language. It’s good reading.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—<span class="epub-i">Raleigh News-Observer</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“Their book has come like a breath of fresh air.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—John Weightman, <span class="epub-i">The Hudson Review</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“An in-depth examination.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—<span class="epub-i">Rolling Stone</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“Hilarious … What can be more irresistible than the opportunity to take some pompous, widely respected intellectual and knock him flat on his ass by exposing him as an idiot?”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—Fred Moody, <span class="epub-i">Seattle Weekly</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“[An] audacious debunking … The authors’ fervor and the precision of their writing makes this a most engaging read.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—<span class="epub-i">Publishers Weekly</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“What they reveal is scandalous … true hilarity … The physicists aren’t staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they’re just standing up for rationality.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—Glenn Dixon, <span class="epub-i">Washington City Paper</span></p>
<p class="fsq">“This is a valuable and well-argued document in one of the key philosophical debates of our time.”</p>
<p class="fsqc">—<span class="epub-i">Kirkus Reviews</span></p>
