<p class="ct" id="ch14"><span class="epub-b">B. Some Comments on the Parody</span></p>
<p class="co">Let us note first that all the references cited in the parody are real, and all the quotes are rigorously accurate; nothing has been invented (unfortunately). The text constantly illustrates what David Lodge calls “a law of academic life: <span class="epub-i">it is impossible to be excessive in flattery of one’s peers.</span>”<a href="note.html#chapter14-110" id="cha-110"><span class="epub-sup">110</span></a></p>
<p class="tx">The purpose of the following remarks is to explain some of the tricks used in constructing the parody, to indicate what exactly is being spoofed in certain passages, and to clarify our position with respect to those ideas. This last point is particularly important, as it is in the nature of a parody to conceal the author’s true views. (Indeed, in many cases Sokal parodied extreme or ambiguously stated versions of ideas that he in fact holds in more nuanced and precisely stated forms.) However, we do not have the space to explain everything, and we shall leave to the reader the pleasure of discovering many other jokes hidden in the text.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="tni">The article’s first two paragraphs set forth an extraordinarily radical version of social constructivism, culminating in the claim that physical reality (and not merely our ideas about it) is “at bottom a social and linguistic construct”. The goal in these paragraphs was not to summarize the views of the <span class="epub-i">Social Text</span> editors—much less those of the authors cited in notes 1–3—but to test whether the bald assertion (without evidence or argument) of such an extreme thesis would raise any eyebrows among the editors. If it did, they never bothered to communicate their misgivings to Sokal, despite his repeated requests for comments, criticisms, and suggestions. See Chapter 4 for our real views on these matters.</p>
<p class="tx">The works praised in this section are dubious at best. Quantum mechanics is <span class="epub-i">not</span> primarily the product of a “cultural fabric”, but the reference to a work by one of <span class="epub-i">Social Text</span>’s editors (Aronowitz) couldn’t hurt. Ditto for the reference to Ross: here “oppositional discourses in post-quantum science” is a euphemism for channeling, crystal therapy, morphogenetic fields, and sundry other New Age enthusiasms. Irigaray’s and Hayles’ exegeses of “gender encoding in fluid mechanics” are analyzed in Chapter 5.</p>
<p class="tx">To say that space-time ceases to be an objective reality in quantum gravity is premature for two reasons. Firstly, a complete theory of quantum gravity does not yet exist, so we do not know what it will imply. Secondly, though quantum gravity <span class="epub-i">will</span> very likely entail radical changes in our concepts of space and time—they may, for example, cease to be fundamental elements in the theory, and become instead an approximate description valid on scales greater than 10<span class="epub-sup">–33</span> centimeters<a href="note.html#chapter14-111" id="cha-111"><span class="epub-sup">111</span></a>—this does not mean that space-time stops being objective, except in the banal sense that tables and chairs are not “objective” because they are composed of atoms. Finally, it is exceedingly unlikely that a theory about space-time on subatomic scales could have valid <span class="epub-i">political</span> implications!</p>
<p class="tx">Note, in passing, the use of postmodernist jargon: “problematized”, “relativized”, and so forth (in particular, about existence itself).</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Quantum Mechanics</span></p>
<p class="tni">This section exemplifies two aspects of postmodernist musings on quantum mechanics: first, a tendency to confuse the technical meanings of words such as “uncertainty” or “discontinuity” with their everyday meanings; and second, a fondness for the most subjectivist writings of Heisenberg and Bohr, interpreted in a radical way that goes far beyond their own views (which are in turn vigorously disputed by many physicists and philosophers of science). But postmodern philosophy loves the multiplicity of viewpoints, the importance of the observer, holism, and indeterminism. For a <span class="epub-i">serious</span> discussion of the philosophical problems posed by quantum mechanics, see the references listed in note 8 (in particular, Albert’s book is an excellent introduction for non-experts).</p>
<p class="tx">Note 13 on Porush is a joke on vulgar economism. In fact, all contemporary technology is based on semiconductor physics, which in turn depends in crucial ways on quantum mechanics.</p>
<p class="txs">McCarthy’s “thought-provoking analysis” (note 20) begins as follows:</p>
<p class="ex">This study traces the nature and consequences of the circulation of desire in a postmodern order of things (an order implicitly modelled on a repressed archetype of the new physics’ fluid particle flows), and it reveals a complicity between scientism, which underpins the postmodern condition, and the sadism of incessant deconstruction, which heightens the intensity of the pleasure-seeking moment in postmodernism.</p>
<p class="stni">The rest of the article is in the same vein.</p>
<p class="tx">Aronowitz’s text (note 25) is a web of confusions and it would take too much space to disentangle them all. Suffice it to say that the problems raised by quantum mechanics (and in particular by Bell’s theorem) have little to do with “time’s reversal” and nothing at all to do with time’s “segmentation into hours and minutes” or “industrial discipline in the early bourgeois epoch”.</p>
<p class="tx"><a id="pg262"/>Goldstein’s book on the mind-body problem (note 26) is an enjoyable <span class="epub-i">novel.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Capra’s speculations on the link between quantum mechanics and Oriental philosophy are, in our view, dubious to say the least. Sheldrake’s theory of “morphogenetic fields”, though popular in New Age circles, hardly qualifies as “in general sound”.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Hermeneutics of Classical General Relativity</span></p>
<p class="tni">The references to physics in this section and the next are, by and large, roughly correct though incredibly shallow; they are written in a deliberately overblown style that parodies some recent popularizations of science. Nevertheless, the text is riddled with absurdities. For example, Einstein’s nonlinear equations are indeed difficult to solve, especially for those who do <span class="epub-i">not</span> have a “traditional” mathematical training. This reference to “nonlinearity” is the start of a recurrent joke, which imitates the misunderstandings rife in postmodernist writings (see <a href="chapter7.html#pg143">here</a>). Wormholes and Gödel’s space-time are rather speculative theoretical ideas; one of the defects of much contemporary scientific popularization is, in fact, to put the best-established and the most speculative aspects of physics on the same footing.</p>
<p class="tx">The notes contain several delights. The quotes from Latour (note 30) and Virilio (note 32) are analyzed in Chapters 6 and 10, respectively. Lyotard’s text (note 36) mixes together the terminology of at least three distinct branches of physics—elementary-particle physics, cosmology, and chaos and complexity theory—in a completely arbitrary way. Serres’ rhapsody on chaos theory (note 36) confuses the state of the system, which can move in a complex and unpredictable way (see Chapter 7), with the nature of time itself, which flows in the conventional manner (“along a line”). Furthermore, percolation theory deals with the flow of fluids in porous media<a href="note.html#chapter14-112" id="cha-112"><span class="epub-sup">112</span></a> and says nothing about the nature of space and time.</p>
<p class="tx">But the primary purpose of this section is to provide a gentle lead-in to the article’s first major gibberish quote, namely Derrida’s comment on relativity (“the Einsteinian constant is not a constant…”). We haven’t the slightest idea what this means—and neither, apparently, does Derrida—but as it is a one-shot abuse, committed orally at a conference, we shall not belabor the point.<a href="note.html#chapter14-113" id="cha-113"><span class="epub-sup">113</span></a> The paragraph following the Derrida quote, which exhibits a gradual crescendo of absurdity, is one of our favorites. It goes without saying that a mathematical constant such as π does not change over time, even if our ideas about it may.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Quantum Gravity</span></p>
<p class="tni">The first major blooper in this section concerns the expression “noncommuting (and hence nonlinear)”. In actual fact, quantum mechanics uses noncommuting operators that are perfectly <span class="epub-i">linear.</span> This joke is inspired by a text of Markley quoted later in the article (see <a href="chapter13.html#pg238">here</a>).</p>
<p class="tx">The next five paragraphs provide a superficial, but essentially correct, overview of physicists’ attempts to construct a theory of quantum gravity. Note, however, the exaggerated emphasis on “metaphors and imagery”, “nonlinearity”, “flux”, and “interconnectedness”.</p>
<p class="tx">The enthusiastic reference to the morphogenetic field is, by contrast, completely arbitrary. Nothing in contemporary science can be invoked to support this New Age fantasy which, in any case, has nothing to do with quantum gravity. Sokal was led to this “theory” by the favorable allusion of Ross (note 46), one of the editors of <span class="epub-i">Social Text.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The reference to Chomsky on the “turf” effect (note 50) was dangerous, as the editors could very well have known this text or looked it up. It is the one we quote in the Introduction (note 11 <a href="note.html#pg12">here</a>), and it says essentially the opposite of what is suggested in the parody.</p>
<p class="tx">The discussion of non-locality in quantum mechanics (note 51) is deliberately confused, but since this problem is rather technical, we can only refer the reader, for example, to Maudlin’s book.</p>
<p class="tx">Note, finally, the illogic embodied in the expression “subjective space-time”. The fact that space-time may cease to be a fundamental entity in a future theory of quantum gravity does not make it in any way “subjective”.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Differential Topology</span></p>
<p class="tni">This section contains the article’s second major piece of authoritative nonsense, namely Lacan’s text on psychoanalytic topology (which we analyze in Chapter 2). The articles applying Lacanian topology to film criticism and the psychoanalysis of AIDS are, sadly, real. Knot theory does indeed have beautiful applications in contemporary physics—as Witten and others have shown—but this has nothing to do with Lacan.</p>
<p class="tx">The last paragraph plays on the postmodern fondness for “multidimensionality” and “nonlinearity” by inventing a nonexistent field: “multidimensional (nonlinear) logic”.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Manifold Theory</span></p>
<p class="tni">The quote from Irigaray is discussed in Chapter 5. The parody again suggests that “conventional” science has an aversion to anything that is “multidimensional”; but the truth is that <span class="epub-i">all</span> interesting manifolds are multidimensional.<a href="note.html#chapter14-114" id="cha-114"><span class="epub-sup">114</span></a> Manifolds with boundary are a classic subject of differential geometry.</p>
<p class="tx">Note 73 is deliberately exaggerated, though we are sympathetic to the idea that economic and political power struggles strongly affect how science gets translated into technology and for whose benefit. Cryptography does indeed have military (as well as commercial) applications and has in recent years become increasingly based on number theory. However, number theory has fascinated mathematicians since antiquity, and until recently it had very few “practical” applications of any kind: it was the branch of pure mathematics <span class="epub-i">par excellence.</span> The reference to Hardy was dangerous: in this very accessible autobiography, he prides himself on working in mathematical fields that have no applications. (There is an additional irony in this reference. Writing in 1941, Hardy listed two branches of science that, in his view, will never have military applications: number theory and Einstein’s relativity. Futurology is a risky enterprise, indeed!)</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="epub-b">Towards a Liberatory Science</span></p>
<p class="tni">This section combines gross confusions about science with exceedingly sloppy thinking about philosophy and politics. Nevertheless, it also contains some ideas—on the link between scientists and the military, on ideological bias in science, on the pedagogy of science—with which we partly agree, at least when these ideas are formulated more carefully. We do not want the parody to provoke unqualified derision toward these ideas, and we refer the reader to the Epilogue for our real views on some of them.</p>
<p class="tx">This section begins by claiming that “postmodern” science has freed itself from objective truth. But, whatever opinions scientists may have on chaos or quantum mechanics, they clearly do not consider themselves “liberated” from the goal of objectivity; were that the case, they would simply have ceased to do science. Nevertheless, a whole book would be needed to disentangle the confusions concerning chaos, quantum physics, and self-organization that underlie this sort of idea; see Chapter 7 for a brief analysis.</p>
<p class="tx"><a id="pg266"/>Having freed science from the goal of objectivity, the article then proposes to politicize science in the worst sense, judging scientific theories not by their correspondence to reality but by their compatibility with one’s ideological preconceptions. The quote from Kelly Oliver, which makes this politicization explicit, raises the perennial problem of self-refutation: how can one know whether or not a theory is “strategic”, except by asking whether it is <span class="epub-i">truly, objectively</span> efficacious in promoting one’s declared political goals? The problems of truth and objectivity cannot be evaded so easily. Similarly, Markley’s claim (“‘Reality’, finally is a historical construct”, note 76) is both philosophically confused and politically pernicious: it opens the door to the worst nationalist and religious-fundamentalist excesses, as Hobsbawm eloquently demonstrates (p. 207–8).</p>
<p class="tx">Here are, finally, some glaring absurdities in this section:</p>
<p class="tx">—Markley (p. 238) puts complex number theory—which, in fact, goes back at least to the early nineteenth century and belongs to mathematics, not physics—in the same bag as quantum mechanics, chaos theory, and the now-largely-defunct hadron bootstrap theory. He has probably confused it with the recent, and very speculative, theories on <span class="epub-i">complexity.</span> Note 86 is an ironic joke at his expense.</p>
<p class="tx">—Many of the 11,000 graduate students working in solid-state physics would be pleasantly surprised to learn that they will all find jobs in their subfield (p. 242).</p>
<p class="tx">—The word “Radon” in the title of Schwartz’s book (note 104) is the name of a mathematician. The book deals with pure mathematics and has nothing to do with nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="tx">—The axiom of equality (note 105) says that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. To link this axiom with nineteenth-century liberalism amounts to writing intellectual history on the basis of verbal coincidences. Ditto for the relation between the axiom of choice<a href="note.html#chapter14-115" id="cha-115"><span class="epub-sup">115</span></a> and the movement for abortion rights. Cohen has indeed shown that neither the axiom of choice nor its negation can be deduced from the other axioms of set theory; but this mathematical result has no political implications whatsoever.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, all the bibliographic entries are rigorously exact, apart from a wink at former French minister of culture Jacques Toubon, who tried to impose the use of French in scientific conferences sponsored by the French government (see Kontsevitch 1994), and at Catalan nationalism (see Smolin 1992).</p>
