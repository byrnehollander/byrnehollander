      <p class="pf"><a class="page1"></a>To walk in northern California through a grove of sequoias, the world’s largest trees, is to move among wordless giants. They compel the human, facing such quiet immensity, to acknowledge her smallness. In Muir Woods in Mill Valley, California, the cross section of a Redwood felled in 1930 has been labeled with significant historical events that correspond to the tree’s growth rings: the Declaration of Independence (1776), the discovery of America (1492), the signing of the Magna Carta (1215), the Battle of Hastings (1066), the birth of the tree (909). This time-keeping tree fascinated both Alfred Hitchcock, who included it in his film <i class="calibre1">Vertigo</i>, and Chris Marker, who cited Hitchcock’s use of it in his own film <i class="calibre1">La jetée</i>. For over a millennium, this singular living entity had inscribed and held its space. The same can be said of few empires. Challenging gravity and the winds, the arboreal being reached upward through time and capitulated only under human duress. What had made possible the impressive stature of this tree? Many factors, of course, contributed to its survival, but its height and breadth were owed largely to the anchor and secret repository of energy below ground: the roots. The tree’s verticality depends on the tenacity of its root structure, which spreads and clutches the soil, siphoning water and minerals from it. <i class="calibre1">Rootedness is the precondition for verticality, or, in metaphysical terms, transcendence</i>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">While the meaning of transcendence varies from discipline to discipline, its etymology contains within it the basic notion of surpassing or overcoming something. Like the word <i class="calibre1">surmount</i>, distance and height are implied in its etymological components <i class="calibre1">trans</i>-, which means “beyond,” and <i class="calibre1">scandere</i>, which means “to climb.” In theological terms, transcendence describes the nature of <a id="p76" class="page1"></a>an experience or even an existence—that of God, the angels, and the dead who have ascended to the heavens—beyond the reality of the material world. To transcend is to overcome materiality, to pass ontologically from a physical state to a metaphysical one. Immanence, the opposite of transcendence, describes that which belongs to the material world as well as manifestations of God on earth, perceptible to humans. The miracle, for example, is immanent evidence of God’s existence and agency that makes itself available to the human witness. To transcend is to go beyond, upward, and toward the yonder along a vertical axis, away from that which is materially given. It is a move toward the qualitatively superior, a liberation from the flaws, shortcomings, weaknesses, and evils associated with human fallibility. The varieties of transcendence, then, include the most familiar spiritual type as well as an intellectual overcoming of the cognitive limits of the human and a historical or anthropological type that allows collectives to triumph over their seemingly innate discordant and bellicose nature. Each of these types of transcendence involves a fundamental improvement of the human, either as an individual or as a collective, to the point of overcoming the human altogether, undoing the ontological and epistemological limits imposed by the burden of embodiment. The possibility of transcendence is predicated on the successful establishment of a stable base from which to move upward along a vertical axis. Metaphysical ascension requires an immovable and nourishing ground from which to begin. Among writers and thinkers in France and Germany of the twentieth century, the metaphor of choice to describe this process—it is indeed a process, as it requires applied effort and time in which to unfold—is the notion of rootedness, which invites the implicit botanification of the human. To imagine humans as rooted, one must imagine the person as a plant.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One of the most familiar iterations of people imagined as plants can be found in Ovid’s <i class="calibre1">Metamorphoses</i>, but Greek precedents exist as well. In his <i class="calibre1">Timaeus</i>, Plato describes the human as a celestial plant whose roots are fixed in the firmament. The human’s vertical bearing is due to this rootedness: while simultaneously sprouting down out of heaven and striving toward it with the uppermost, soulful part of the body, the human is a bridge between the earthly and the divine. For Plato, our head, with its intellect and soul, is metaphorized as a root. He writes: “We should think of the most authoritative part of our soul as a guardian spirit given to each of us by god, living in the summit of the body, which can properly be said to lift us from the earth towards our home in heaven, as if we were a heavenly and not earthbound plant. For where the soul first grew into being, from there our divine part attaches us by the head <a id="p77" class="page1"></a>to heaven, like a plant by its roots, and keeps our body upright.”<a id="fn146r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn146">1</a> Plato’s version of gravitational pull makes heaven, not earth, gravity’s center. The godly suspension of the human is contingent upon the embeddedness of the soul in the extraterrestrial plane, as the “up there” draws people toward it. Our uprightness, figuratively and literally, is attributed to the divine power’s planting of the human in the celestial realm. This early metaphor, I argue, is lodged deeply in the collective subconscious of Western civilization and accounts for many stubborn notions of provenance, belonging, and the relationship between the material and the spiritual. Formulated in antiquity, the relationship between root, verticality, and God continues in the Christian tradition and has particular resonance in the French and German philosophical, literary, and political realms. This triangulation is unmistakable, for example, in the notion of Jews as a rootless, and thus unrighteous, people, reflected in the long history of anti-Semitism in Europe. Paul Claudel, the father of neo-Catholicism in postwar France, in his <i class="calibre1">A Poet before the Cross</i> (<i class="calibre1">Un poète regarde la croix</i>, 1935), suggests that Christ’s redemption of humanity was rooted in the Garden of Eden; in his depiction, the Tree of Knowledge transforms into the crucifix, thus making a connection between the tree, the origins of humanity, and transcendent salvation. Simone Weil argued in the 1940s that the easy capitulation of France to Germany in World War II was caused by a collective loss of roots; the path to transcendence, in her view, is the cultivation of new ones. Finally, shifting from the realm of theological or political discourse to that of philosophy, Heidegger’s notion of <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>, or groundedness, confirms again the link between stability down below and transcendence up above in Western thought. His ideas on groundedness influenced French poststructuralist thinkers in the second half of the twentieth century.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The first part of this chapter discloses many more examples of the link between root, verticality, and transcendence, emphasizing the ubiquity of this tripartite symbolic configuration in the French and German cultural <i class="calibre1">patrimoine</i>. The second part of the chapter treats the very specific Platonic notion of the “invertibility” of the plant as a figure for metaphysical transformation, which persisted in France throughout the centuries. For the Encyclopédistes, the botanist Duhamel’s successful eighteenth-century experiments in uprooting and replanting willow trees’ branches into the soil upside-down become a figure of the seemingly peculiar but absolutely necessary task of the philosopher. The soul of Paul Valéry’s Monsieur Teste—a fictional character who is <a id="p78" class="page1"></a>an embodied thought and, like Valéry’s Lucretius, “a Plant that thinks”<a id="fn147r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn147">2</a>—is described by the character’s wife as “some peculiar plant whose root, and not foliage, would thrust against nature, toward the light”;<a id="fn148r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn148">3</a> and, in Michel Tournier’s retelling of the Crusoe story, Friday anticipates and “models” Robinson’s metaphysical transformation by uprooting and inverting some of the island’s plants and by disguising his own body as a tree. While such botanical inversions may be read as mere examples of the improvisational potential of the plant and the human to adapt in the face of predicament, they can be read more compellingly as metaphors for metaphysical conversion, as I will show.</p>
