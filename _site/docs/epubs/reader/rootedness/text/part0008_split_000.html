      <h1 class="ct1">Welcome to the Rhizosphere</h1>
      <p class="pf">The day after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast of the United States on October 29, 2012, the entire region was strewn with uprooted trees. A walk in a nature preserve near my town in New Jersey took me past fallen, decades-old trees and their jutting roots. When trees this massive fall, they take with them a thick circumference of land, leaving holes that fill quickly with water. The roots I saw were never deep; they were gnarled and weblike, proliferating horizontally in an erratic network. Roots generally reveal traces of themselves at the base of trees, but merely to signal the extent of their unseen-ness. We are able to scrutinize roots only when they are decontextualized, exposed by weather, age, disease, or human transplantation. Catching sight of a full root happens only in instances of violence, infirmity, or death. This could account in part for the metaphorical darkness of our associations with the root, compounded by the literal darkness of its subterranean dwelling space. Roots commune with the dead. Their composition is reliant on decomposition. Botanists have given the name rhizosphere to the area of soil around the roots of plants, their subterranean dwelling. We will enter the rhizosphere now together.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This first chapter provides a broad overview of the way the root has been imagined. There are a few basic patterns of its metaphorization: root as home, root as genealogical origin, root as miniature person, root as the past, and root as a severable connection to any phenomenon, particularly the environment. Carl Jung and Gaston Bachelard recognized its power as a subconscious image, but the root is clearly a figure for the subconscious itself. This metaphorâ€™s broad applicability to such a variety of circumstances reveals a meaningful pattern in the human psyche: Continuity is preferable to discontinuity. The root is <a id="p15" class="page1"></a>an integrating metaphor, one that allows for connections to be made between past, present, and future, between remote geographic spaces, between neighbors, between the human and its ecosystem. To be rootless is to lack context. What becomes clear in the incessant reliance on the metaphor of rootedness is that the desire for temporal, spatial, epistemological, and ontological continuity is an elementary human need. In the following pages, the chronicle of a species at odds with itself unfolds. Figurative language is the outlet for a deep-seated apprehension about permanent estrangement from the context whence we came.</p>
