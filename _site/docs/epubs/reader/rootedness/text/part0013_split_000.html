      <p class="pf"><a class="page1"></a>As you have perhaps noticed, my study so far has made regular use of etymology in various ways. What is it I hope to show or accomplish by pointing out the occluded meanings found in the roots of words? While etymologies are often enlisted as incontrovertible proof of the latency of an idea or of the fact that we are mostly unaware of what we really <i class="calibre1">mean</i> when we speak or write, I can justify my “etymologizing method” by saying that for me, word roots are not particularly helpful as probative instruments but serve better as sites of the associative <i class="calibre1">potential</i> of words and concepts. If I invoke an etymology, it is not to suggest that I’ve discovered some primordial meaning hidden in the innermost kernel of a term but rather to show that forgotten roots sometimes give hints about why certain words evoke peripheral associations or to show that by recalling these roots, language can be poetically revitalized. My etymologizing gesture is only a secondhand gesture, the self-conscious reenactment of a practice that has for centuries served writers, philosophers, politicians, and theologians in Europe—and undoubtedly elsewhere—as a tool for convincing, justifying, legitimating, subverting, and playing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In twentieth-century Continental Europe, a century and a place that witnessed two world wars, atomic proliferation, ideological clashes, decolonization, and increasingly asymmetrical terrorist maneuvers, many believed that a higher truth could be had if we could simply return to the root of things, approximating ourselves with an essence that had been covered by obstructive and debilitating layers. Language became once again a primary site for root-seeking. Like thoughts, language is imagined as a kind of plant that sprouts from a root and must be tended to. This explains why we call an anthology <a id="p179" class="page1"></a>of literary excerpts a <i class="calibre1">florilegium</i>. The poet Edmond Jabès had the botanical aspects of language in mind when he titled his poem “V’herbe,” a combination of “verb” and <i class="calibre1">herbe</i>, or grass.<a id="fn370r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn370">1</a> From the retracing of etymological roots to the search for root metaphors, ground metaphors, or absolute metaphors, many aspects of language were interrogated in hopes of locating the primeval linguistic basis of thought and action. But as the century progressed, people seemed to lose faith in the noble root quest. Such a quest assumed first of all that the ancestors knew better and that language was a living bond with our forebears. This conviction, which requires a deferral and a deference to ancestral wisdom, insinuates that the present is necessarily less authentic than the past and that language moves from an original, concentrated essence to a watered-down, cloudy lexicon.<a id="fn371r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn371">2</a> It is common practice to treat ancestors as infallible and infinitely wise. But a wealth of controverting evidence leads to the obvious question: “If they had it so right, how did it all go so wrong?” Furthermore, many doubted the assumption that if we could just find our lost roots and reestablish them in today’s context, all problems would be solved. Such roots may have been functional in their original time and place, but their efficacy may have been context-specific and nontransferable to the complex intricacies of twentieth-century politics, philosophy, and social life. Finally, a loss of faith in the redemptive power of word roots was due to the misuse of etymology by many writers to justify their own agendas; mistaken or purely invented etymological reconstructions abounded during the period. With little restraint, these erroneous retracings were employed to reinforce political, theological, and ethical arguments and to lay claims to higher truth over one’s enemies. Rediscovered etymologies—and even faked ones—were used often to legitimate a particular position and to undermine ideas that could not be etymologically supported.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The next section of this chapter investigates the obsession in the twentieth century with the retracing of word roots. Various thinkers turned to or away from etymology for a wide variety of reasons. Some of them placed all of their faith in the redemptive power of salvaged etymologies. Others considered it a <a id="p180" class="page1"></a>playful space for punning and for refreshing language, a way to undo lexical petrification. Still others tried to subvert the reconstructionists’ efforts by highlighting the misleading aspects of etymological devotion. Consistent among all of these various debates on etymology are the sustained themes of the subterranean, purity, source, and genealogy. As we have seen, these themes are part and parcel of the metaphor of rootedness, even in its linguistic iteration. The pure and hidden history of European culture finds a comfortable mythology in the very medium through which it is told: language. The various deployments of etymology in twentieth-century France and Germany presented in this chapter provide the clearest support of my claim that the more distant and unreliable the root, the easier it is to requisition it for ideological purposes.</p>
