      <p class="pf">Another notable poststructuralist critic of etymology is Maurice Blanchot, who includes himself in a genealogy of etymological skeptics like Paulhan. Cautioning against the abuse of the discipline in a well-known passage from <i class="calibre1">The Writing of Disaster</i> (<i class="calibre1">L’écriture du désastre</i>, 1980), Blanchot warns of the seduction of filiation and its misapplication to a nonbiologic phenomenon. Blanchot expresses the same reservations as Paulhan regarding the legitimacy of etymology. Essentially dissolving the distinction between academic etymology and popular etymology, he argues that the science-minded etymologist is fooling himself. Despite stringent efforts to prove his legitimacy, his vocation is no more noble than that of a layman who hears uncanny and entertaining <a id="p211" class="page1"></a>resonances between words. What is concerning about the indiscriminate use of etymology is that those who use it seem to have suspended their critical faculty, accepting the validity of their findings without question. Our affective need for a feeling of connectedness to the past trumps all rationality, leading even the staunchest rationalists toward a discipline they know, perhaps secretly, to be purely speculative. In a subsequent passage, he identifies the most troubling aspect of etymology: its implied eschatological conception of history.<a id="fn472r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn472">103</a> As we have seen, Levinas argued that Heidegger’s texts are rife with pagan mysticism,<a id="fn473r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn473">104</a> and Blanchot pursues the connection between root-seeking and mysticism in his identification of the etymological tendency toward a mystical and teleological vision of history. The beginning of words leads us to the end of days. Even the most rational of thinkers are liable to turn toward the esoteric <i class="calibre1">etymon</i> but cannot acknowledge that such a turn is illogical—or, perhaps, prelogical. Blanchot writes plainly, “What attracts us to etymology is its unreasonable part more than what it explains: we are interested by the form of enigma that it preserves or doubles as it deciphers” (106). He goes on to argue that writing guarantees itself a position as the trove of secrets (119–20). In addition to its enigmatic promise, etymological research seems to provide a cure for the feeling of existential homelessness. The primordial word cannot be demolished and thus invites all users of a particular idiom to rediscover and dwell in it, to become newly rooted in a remoteness that had been nearly forgotten (86). Burgeoning is a figure for futurity; the allegorical root always contains within it the possibility of a new <i class="calibre1">generation</i>. In French, the term for <i class="calibre1">etymon</i>, or original word, is the <i class="calibre1">mot souche</i>, translated literally as “stump word,” but a stump that contains the possibility of life inside it, like the stem cell (<i class="calibre1">cellule souche</i>). It is a stump, but not a dead one. Blanchot goes on to illustrate the circular logic of the appeal to etymology, the “circularity from which all languages draw their fecundity,” and shows the centrality of botanical tropes in this logic.<a id="fn474r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn474">105</a> Blanchot <a id="p212" class="page1"></a>yields momentarily, acknowledging at least one benefit of a certain kind of etymologizing. The minor saving grace of creative etymologies, their encouragement of the thinker to “develop variations upon certain thoughts and words,” emphasizes the expressive potential of the discipline, which stands in opposition to its truth-reviving imperative. But this slight “rightness” of the more creative-minded etymologizers ultimately does not redeem the discipline for him. In Blanchot’s extended critique of the human as an “etymologizing animal,” he seeks to expose this pattern as a human epistemological habit, a curious need to know things that have been confirmed as unknowable. While Michel Leiris has argued that “the everyday meaning and the etymological meaning of a word can teach us nothing about ourselves, since they represent the collective part of language, which was made for all people and not for each of us individually,”<a id="fn475r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn475">106</a> Blanchot argues that the collective search for (word) roots tells something quite tangible about humans, namely that by representing the past through a clean and linear textual story (an etymological reconstruction, a written testimony, a history book), the past is made provisionally manageable; however, nothing about such a story precludes a repetition of the same tragedies again and again. In fact, writing used in this way seems almost to precipitate the recurrence of such events. Already the format of Blanchot’s book, a series of disjointed prose fragments, challenges the way histories and arguments have typically been constructed as cohesive and logical narratives or reasonings, regardless of what they attempt to communicate. In a move similar to the one seen in Derrida’s later texts, which put into practice his hesitations about the written word and its uncontested hegemony, Blanchot refuses to write about collective trauma—in the form of the Holocaust or of other specific or unspecific forms of disaster—using the conventional formats proffered by literature, philosophy, and history. It makes sense that he takes etymology to task, since this discipline relies on a similar myth of cohesion. The tropes and conventions that surround the telling of disaster through written language are unsettled in his text, making clear that Blanchot’s indictment of etymological reconstruction is inseparable from his indictment of uncritical reconstructions of the traumatic Event. The abuses of etymology should matter to us, he <a id="p213" class="page1"></a>argues, because they follow a logic similar to the one that guides the (re)writing of the Event into an innocuous format, a clean and safe representation that makes it easier to accept as a story and as a history, and as cleanly dismissible as a fictional one.</p>

      <p class="pf">This chapter has brought attention to language as the site of root-seeking. Not only is the human body regularly botanified; so are thought—shown in <a class="page1" href="part0009_split_000.html#ch02">chapter 2</a> through the examples of Ponge and Valéry’s vegetal depictions of thinking—and language as well. Analogies with the plant world are seen in every aspect of what makes the human unique as a species. We may add etymological genealogy to the field of biologic genealogies, genealogies of thought, and transmission of land and cultural heritage as yet another site of interrogation into the relationship between the present and the past. Language is particularly enticing as such a site because, while it is a part of everyday life and the necessary medium through which we communicate, its most distant roots are absolutely untraceable, a blank surface upon which countless narratives may be projected, narratives that guarantee power to some and powerlessness to others. I have shown how, through the very medium of language, various thinkers have attempted to sequester its unknowable aspects and argue for the primacy of this or that culture over all others. This is accomplished most handily through a mysticized chronicle of a word. Words are cast as humans with supernatural births, with living genealogies, and their biographies accentuate the most remote and inscrutable aspects of their lives. The holy bodies of these words are ripe for exhumation, a rebirth after a subterranean interval. To use the Icelandic musician Björk’s expression, the reconstruction of etymological origins is an attempt to recuperate a lost “pagan poetry.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The mystery, the enigma, words invested with arcane meaning, the beginning and end of all things: despite Europe’s ostensible advancements through the Enlightenment project, the etymological obsession that marks the twentieth century (and the twenty-first as well) is evidence of an irrepressible attraction to Endarkenment.<a id="fn476r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn476">107</a> The mechanics of this attraction are complicated. A search for roots seems at first to be an “enlightened” or “enlightening” search for truth, an attempt to find logical arguments to explain or undo certain <a id="p214" class="page1"></a>patterns in human behavior. By finding what has been forgotten in language, perhaps more sense can be made of the conduct of the species. Thinkers who use etymologies or other forms of root-seeking believe themselves to be involved in a rational scrutiny of the beginnings of culture. However, from the examples I have provided, it is clear that those who engage in such investigations are often predisposed to mysticism and to an understanding of the world in terms of latent, supernatural codes. Root-seeking is a prerational impulse, a conviction that origins are pure and that beginnings are better. The gesture of exhumation (an exposure, from the depths, to the light of truth) implied in etymological research is, in actuality, a form of occultation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Jean Starobinski articulated what is perhaps the best formulation for dealing with the past without surrendering to mystification. Instead of a binary choice between an ignorance of the past and an irrational indebtedness to it, he proposes this solution: “There is no reason . . . why our interest in the cultural past should diminish if, instead of representing a part of ourselves, this past consisted in things other men have accomplished within a conceptual framework which is not and will never be ours, using a language in which we recognize nothing of ourselves.”<a id="fn477r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn477">108</a> Starobinski cuts the imagined umbilical cord between contemporary and ancestral culture. Because it is virtually impossible to locate a true cultural continuity between ourselves and the most remote of our ancestors, the imaginative and superstitious mind would rather fill in the gaps of history with fantasy in order to remain a part of it. The fabulator would do better to dispense altogether with this tendency, suggests Starobinski, admitting that we have no meaningful connection to those who came before us other than a symbolic one. People are possessed by and possessive of their ancestors, but this is a treatable condition, in his view. By severing the imaginary bind and opening up the mind toward multiple histories rather than one’s own singularly important (and mostly fabulated) History, the hazardous aspects of ancestor worship, such as the sacralization of the banal and the celebration of the past to the detriment of the present, could be neutralized. As I showed in <a class="page1" href="part0011_split_000.html#ch04">chapter 4</a>, Vilém Flusser pursues synchronically what Starobinski has undertaken here diachronically; while Starobinski confronts the dangerous sacralizing gesture of ancestor fetish, Flusser confronts the dangerous and timeless sacralization of the homeland.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The ways in which etymology was instrumentalized throughout the twentieth century—particularly in France and Germany, the epicenters of consequential shifts in the root metaphor—show in reduced scale the broader <a id="p215" class="page1"></a>tension that prevailed in various discourses during the period, namely, the tension between an etiological worldview, a teleological one, and other narratives of human agency. An etiological viewpoint thinks from the beginning, looking toward the origin for answers. A teleological one thinks from the end backward, looking toward finalities and “destinies” for answers about human trajectory and purpose. The two are not mutually exclusive. One can easily create a narrative that claims that the beginnings and the futures of the human are part of a well-designed plan. Dissenting voices include those that dismiss an etiological and teleological view of culture altogether, and those that tweak the idea of indebtedness either to the past or to the future, claiming only a partial responsibility of the human to his forebears or to his progeny. His present is shaped in part by past and future, but he can act in accord or discord with these pulls.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the following chapter, I will show how the <i class="calibre1">vocabulary</i> used to describe ways of knowing changes throughout the century while, in reality, the difference between so-called modern and postmodern epistemologies remains the same. Again, this shift relies on a botanical vocabulary, a move from a root-based epistemology to a rhizomatic one, using the metaphor offered by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. Their metaphor has had lasting appeal, particularly in the fields of philosophy, literature, history, and the social sciences. Confusion still remains, however, over whether such a seemingly “groundbreaking” concept has actually destabilized old disciplines and methods or whether the category of the rhizomatic is an extension of “rooted” epistemologies.</p>
