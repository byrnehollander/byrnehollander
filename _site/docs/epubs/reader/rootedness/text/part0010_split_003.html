      <p class="pf">Like Claudel, Paul Valéry (1871–1945) invested the tree with symbolic power and vitalist purpose. In “Dialogue de l’arbre” (1943), Valéry stages an exchange between Lucretius, the first-century Roman philosopher-poet most famous for his <i class="calibre1">De rerum natura</i> (<i class="calibre1">On the Nature of Things</i>), and Tityrus, the shepherd figure from Virgil’s <i class="calibre1">Eclogues</i>,<a id="fn171r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn171">26</a> as the two reflect on a tree and all its intimations. As Theodore Ziolkowski notes, “Tityrus represents the poet who apprehends nature directly and instinctively while Lucretius, like Valéry himself, perceives meanings and relationships.”<a id="fn172r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn172">27</a> Without restraint, it is Tityrus who recounts his passion for the tree with spontaneity and starry-eyed wonder. His unmeasured meditations dwell on the surface of the tree, on its visible form, and on the reveries triggered by its image. In contrast, Lucretius puts himself in the place of the tree, embodying it and embedding his own subjectivity in it. He says to Tityrus:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">I wished to speak to you of the feeling I sometimes have of being Plant myself, a Plant that thinks, but that does not distinguish its diverse potencies, nor its form from its force, nor its port from its place. Forces, forms, size, and volume, and duration are but a single river of existence, a tide whose liquid expires in hard solidity, whilst the dim will of growth rises and bursts, and would again become will—in the light and innumerable form of seeds. And I feel myself live the unheard-of enterprise of the Type of the Plant, invading space, improvising a dream of branches, plunging in the midst of the mire, and drinking in the heady salts of the earth, whilst in the free air it opens by degrees to the bounty of the sky, green thousands of lips. . . . As much it goes down deep, so much it rises up: it chains the shapeless, it attacks the void; it struggles that it may change all into itself, for that is its Idea! . . . O Tityrus, it seems to me I am sharing with my whole being in that meditation—powerful, active, and rigorously followed up in its design—which the Plant bids me make.<a id="fn173r" class="fnref1" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn173">28</a></p>

      <p class="pcon">Again we encounter botanical purpose, here termed “dessein,” comparable to Paul Claudel’s image of the holy tree charged with a “devoir végétatif.” Valéry’s vitalist vision is apparent throughout his oeuvre, notably in well-known works <a id="p93" class="page1"></a>such as his poem “The Graveyard by the Sea” (“Le cimetière marin”) in which the poetic voice implores, “One must try to live” (“Il faut tenter de vivre”). Despite Valéry’s denouncements of Bergsonian vitalism, critic Maurice Bémol identifies vitalist tendencies in his poetic oeuvre, calling him “un grand poète de l’élan vital.”<a id="fn174r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn174">29</a> As we will see, his character Monsieur Teste is the result of the vitalist pursuit of extending the life of an idea. In Valéry’s “Dialogue,” he depicts the tree not only as a life-form but as an organic being whose whole <i class="calibre1">raison d’être</i> is the expansion of itself as a body and as a <i class="calibre1">concept</i>; let us not forget that Saussure used the figure of the tree in his <i class="calibre1">Cours de linguistique générale</i> (1915) to illustrate the relationship between the signified, the signifier, and the referent. In Lucretius’s monologue, knowing and being merge into a single concept: the philosopher’s botanized body. The plant, with its “dessein,” or purpose, impels him to put himself in its place, to live the visceral and the veneer simultaneously, to embody the tree and the idea of the tree. In general, the connection between the botanical and the expansion of knowledge is evident in concepts such as the <i class="calibre1">seminar</i>, originally a word used to describe a breeding ground for plants (<i class="calibre1">seminarium</i>) but adopted later through German to mean the student-professor milieu where learning is a kind of germination. Describing someone as <i class="calibre1">cultivé</i>, cultivated or cultured, also equates knowledge with botanical growth, as does the “planting of an idea” in someone’s mind. This botanical and epistemological metaphor abounds in Valéry’s oeuvre, in which he often organicizes the thought as a plant, but also as an animal or even a human in the case of Monsieur Teste.<a id="fn175r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn175">30</a> The plant, then, is a figure for the expansion of thought and a metaphor for the way being organizes itself. In Lucretius’s account, the plant “enchaîne l’informe, . . . attaque le vide,” translating nothingness into being, but with fervency and purpose. In an aphorism from Valéry’s “Analecta,” he writes, “Consciousness is horrified by the void” (712), suggesting a shared need by the brain and the tree to fill the abyss with somethingness. The tree improvises a “rêve de ramure” or “dream of <a id="p94" class="page1"></a>branches,” making the imagined real, pushing <i class="calibre1">puissance</i> (“potentiality”) into <i class="calibre1">acte</i> (“actuality”). The tree is life; it is knowledge; it is being.<a id="fn176r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn176">31</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">In his dialogue with Tityrus, Lucretius also describes the tree as a kind of river, with its various ramifications resembling tributaries and its roots pushing forth through the dark soil with purpose: “There is no hideous beast of the sea more greedy and multiple than this tousle of roots, blindly certain in their progress towards the depths and dampnesses of the earth. But their advancement proceeds, irresistible, with a slowness which makes it implacable as time. Into the empire of the dead, of the mole and the worm, the toil of the tree inserts the powers of a strange subterranean will.”<a id="fn177r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn177">32</a> The plant’s purposiveness is depicted here as “une étrange volonté souterraine,” strange in its uncanny resemblance to human will. One immediately recognizes that Guillevic’s understanding of vegetal will as explored in <a class="page1" href="part0009_split_000.html#ch02">chapter 2</a> is quite sympathetic to Valéry’s description of it. Moving downward and laterally, the plant improvises its own nutritive siphoning mechanism and drops its own organic anchor, securing a stable base for the ladder upward into the celestial sphere. This transcendence has little to do with God or spiritual transcendence; it is intellectual, a new frontier for the possibilities of the human mind.<a id="fn178r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn178">33</a> Near the end of their dialogue, Lucretius says to Tityrus: “Is not to meditate to deepen oneself in Order? Just see how the blind Tree with its diverging limbs grows up about itself, faithful to Symmetry. Life in it calculates; it raises up a structure; and radiates its rhythm through branches and their twigs, and every twig its leaf, even at the very points marked by the nascent future.”<a id="fn179r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn179">34</a> Paul Valéry, an established literary voice in France in the first half of the twentieth century and, like Claudel, a member of the Académie française, constructed the tree as a figure for the proliferation of thought and being. In the examples of botanically metaphorized transcendence I have pointed out in this section, the rooted human has the potential to follow the plant as a model and surmount limits, often self-imposed, going beyond the state of the actual to the state of the ideal. As we shall see in the following pages, Valéry infuses another of his characters, Monsieur Teste, with this same botanical <i class="calibre1">puissance vitale</i> (vital potency or <a id="p95" class="page1"></a>power) and transcendent thrust shared between Lucretius and the Tree. Teste, however, is not an upright plant but an inverted one.</p>
