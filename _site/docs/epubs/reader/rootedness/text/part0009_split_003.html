      <p class="pf">While Francis Ponge is often praised as France’s most botanically minded twentieth-century poet, Eugène Guillevic (1907–1997) may be the most root-minded. A Leftist, he believed that everyone was “either on the side of the oppressed or on the side of the oppressors,”<a id="fn97r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn97">44</a> although he regretted his early support of Stalinism before he understood the dictatorial extremism of the Soviet Communist Party. As a trained economist, he spent much of his life researching how fiscal politics touches the lives of real people. He was<a id="p51" class="page1"></a>close with Paul Eluard, a fellow Communist, and was one of France’s more politically engaged poets of the mid-twentieth century. Guillevic—who signed his work only with his surname, refusing the name given him by his oppressive mother—called poetry his “source” and his “roots.”<a id="fn98r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn98">45</a> A devotee of dictionaries and etymologies, Guillevic rarely let a word slip by without tracing its most fundamental roots. He described himself as a “man of prehistory” who “lives in what is elementary.”<a id="fn99r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn99">46</a> He resisted nationalism in favor of regionalism.<a id="fn100r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn100">47</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Guillevic is best known as the poetic celebrant of Breton regionalism. In his obituary in the <i class="calibre1">Independent</i>, the necrographer James Kirkup writes of Guillevic, “The poet had a sturdy figure that made him resemble a walking menhir from his native Brittany.”<a id="fn101r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn101">48</a> Kirkup’s allusion to the prehistorically erected stones that dot the Breton countryside, which Guillevic celebrates in his poetry, is standard fare in biographical depictions of the poet. Perhaps his self-fashioning through the countless filmed and printed interviews he conducted throughout his lifetime helped create a cohesive—and often clichéd—depiction of a man sprung up directly from a land of Celtic ancestors. We find menhirs on the cover of Denise Levertov’s translation of his poems, which presents him this way in the introduction:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Guillevic is a Breton, born at Carnac of peasant stock. His poetry has deep roots in that inheritance. The great ritual places of the Celts, whether in Wales or Cornwall, Ireland or Brittany, the places where the great and small stones or <i class="calibre1">menhirs</i>, are gathered in powerful and enigmatic testimony of forgotten certainties, are landscapes of a profound austerity. In such landscapes the senses are undistracted from the elemental: rock, sky, sea are there not backgrounds but presences. Beginning in such a place, Guillevic learned to recognize all else in life likewise as <i class="calibre1">presence</i>, not as incidental properties. Man, bird, cloud, lake, night, death, the sunlight—he knows them as Powers and Principalities, meets <a id="p52" class="page1"></a>them face to face, and disdains the folly of attempting to use them as mere autobiographical adornments. This atheist is a radically religious poet.<a id="fn102r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn102">49</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">I cite this passage at length to give another clear example of radical portraiture in its most explicit form, as described in <a class="page1" href="part0008_split_000.html#ch01">chapter 1</a> in the introductory passage of Maupassant’s <i class="calibre1">Le horla</i>. The filial logic implied in Levertov’s statement that he was born “of peasant stock” might strike us as outmoded today; all talk of stock, breed, lineage, pedigree, and parentage is used now more often to talk about animals than people. As we see in Levertov’s passage, the features of the land mark the person. Guillevic is the poet that he is only because of the countless indiscernible ways in which the land left its signature on his psyche. This belief, analyzed throughout this book, relies on a specific philosophy of the human, one that takes the person as a creature whose immanent domain is the ground up from which it raises itself vertically toward the heavens, like a plant. This need to believe that people somehow belong to the land that yielded them, thus property of their property, is one of the common ways people make sense of the seeming arbitrariness of their birthplaces, their <i class="calibre1">incunabula</i>. The human, made of and sprung from the <i class="calibre1">humus</i>, is first swaddled in soil. Transcendence is imaginable, as I show in <a class="page1" href="part0010_split_000.html#ch03">chapter 3</a>, only as the result of some form of immanent rootedness, most often in a place. Note Levertov’s use of the word “radically”—a problematic term, as we’ll see later—to describe the religiosity of Guillevic’s atheism. Radical portraiture always uses a language of original autochthony, of the geographically lesioned body and mind. The interesting part is that Levertov herself never felt rooted anywhere; perhaps it is for this reason that she was attracted to the poems of a rooted son.<a id="fn103r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn103">50</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">In his literature and interviews, Guillevic insists on the placeness of his poetry; nearly everything he wrote is topophilic.<a id="fn104r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn104">51</a> He surrounded himself with other earthen poets—like Kenneth White, the Scottish founder of geopoetics—equally invested in the relationship between place and person.<a id="fn105r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn105">52</a> From an <a id="p53" class="page1"></a>elemental perspective, Gaston Bachelard considered him a terrestrial poet.<a id="fn106r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn106">53</a> Guillevic published his first book of poetry, <i class="calibre1">Terraqué</i> (which means “terraqueous”), in 1942, the same publication year as Ponge’s <i class="calibre1">Le parti pris des choses</i>. Having spent part of his childhood in Alsace, Guillevic was a fluent reader of German and kept Georg Trakl’s poetry at his bedside during adolescence.<a id="fn107r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn107">54</a> He was also greatly influenced by Christian Morgenstern, who was best known for his absurdist poetry and his later commitment to anthroposophy. Consider, for example, Morgenstern’s poem “The Two Roots” (“Die zwei Wurzeln”) published in his collection <i class="calibre1">Gallows Songs</i> (<i class="calibre1">Galgenlieder</i>, 1905), a copy of which Guillevic owned:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Zwei Tannenwurzeln groß und alt</p>
        <p class="sl">unterhalten sich im Wald.</p>
        <p class="slf">Was droben in den Wipfeln rauscht,</p>
        <p class="sl">das wird hier unten ausgetauscht.</p>
        <p class="slf">Ein altes Eichhorn sitzt dabei</p>
        <p class="sl">und strickt wohl Strümpfe für die zwei.</p>
        <p class="slf">Die eine sagt: knig. Die andre sagt: knag.</p>
        <p class="sl">Das ist genug für einen Tag.</p>
        <p class="slf">[A pair of pine roots, old and dark,</p>

      </div>
      <p class="pcon">This poem, like a child’s nursery rhyme, includes anthropomorphized protagonists whose circumstances in the grand scheme of things are very small; no epic themes or philosophical heaviness here. But this humor was of great appeal to Guillevic, whose own simple style and pared-down poetics maintain at all times a reliable lightness. What he appreciated most about Morgenstern was his frequent untranslatability, something he confirmed firsthand when trying to translate the German poems into French. Another possible source of appreciation, perhaps a subconscious one, is Morgenstern’s connection with anthroposophy, the philosophy founded by Rudolf Steiner, who describes it this way: “Anthroposophy has its roots in the perceptions—already gained—into the spiritual world. Yet these are no more than its roots. The branches, leaves, blossoms, and fruits of anthroposophy grow into all the fields of human life and action.”<a id="fn109r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn109">56</a> Steiner considered Morgenstern a true representative of anthroposophy, and the language of roots is omnipresent in his anthroposophic poetry and epigrams. In a later chapter, I show the heavy reliance on root metaphors in anthroposophic circles, but I mention this influence here because of Guillevic’s own special attraction to roots and the importance he placed in his poetry on the cultivation of a deliberate autochthony. Guillevic knew little of Morgenstern’s life, saying only that he’d heard that he died a theosophist,<a id="fn110r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn110">57</a> but the features of anthroposophical thought—such as the desire to wholly integrate the human into work, education, domestic life, and nature—can be found in most of Guillevic’s poetry. The terrestrial sympathies of Guillevic, Morgenstern, and the anthroposophists are common in regionalist, domophilic (home-loving), and ecocentric literature.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Guillevic published an entire poetry book on the theme of roots in 1973, entitled <i class="calibre1">Racines</i> and accompanied by “compositions” made by Robert Blanchet, which included imprints made by actual roots. Many of the ideas in this extended poem seem to come directly from Bachelard’s chapter on roots, a <a id="p55" class="page1"></a>book he had undoubtedly read, since he was aware that Bachelard cites him in the book and took him as a terrestrial poet. The energy of Guillevic’s poem conveys what I will call “radical trying”: the botanical embodiment of an underground <i class="calibre1">élan vital</i>, a burrowing will that implicates itself consciously in the earth, the active process of a de-alienation. In contrast to Bachelard, who viewed the root as a figure of repose, Guillevic saw it as a figure of <i class="calibre1">volonté</i>.<a id="fn111r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn111">58</a> The root’s force resembles Heidegger’s gloss of the term <i class="calibre1">Wesen</i>, which generally means “essence” but which he nuanced to mean emergence, coming into being, or “root-unfolding.”<a id="fn112r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn112">59</a> This pushing through the soil at a pace imperceptible to humans is the action of pure <i class="calibre1">physis</i>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The poem is essayistic in that it tries out a series of thoughts, separated by asterisks, the philosophical questions of a meditative subject. This is a poem that thinks. The empathic free verse considers the world from the roots’ point of view, asking implicitly, “What is it that roots want?” and dozens of other philosophical questions throughout the verses: What is the nature of time for a plant? Do the roots “know” what is going on above ground in the branches, and vice versa? Is a root a thing or a presence? What can the root teach us about human mortality? The addressee of the poem shifts throughout, as the narrating voice alternates between first-, second-, and third-person narration; between <i class="calibre1">tu</i> and <i class="calibre1">vous</i>; between indicative and imperative. The fragmentation created by the asterisks and the spaces that divide the verses gives the poem an aphoristic quality; it resembles the haiku in its concision, clarity, and natural theme.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The epistemological thematics of Guillevic’s poem insist on what is knowable and how.<a id="fn113r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn113">60</a> The narrating voice says of the oak, “Through him, I know” <a id="p56" class="page1"></a>(“À travers lui,/Je sais”).<a id="fn114r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn114">61</a> The root, too, is a path to knowing; in direct contact with it (<i class="calibre1">toucher</i>, <i class="calibre1">palper</i>, <i class="calibre1">regarder</i>), the human comes to understand that the root is both you (<i class="calibre1">toi-même</i>) and the opposite of you (<i class="calibre1">l’anti-toi-même</i>) (93). Otherness becomes a source of creative contemplation. A living paradox, the root is both hard and soft, rigid and ductile.<a id="fn115r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn115">62</a> It is depicted interchangeably as a singular entity (<i class="calibre1">la racine</i>) and at times as a plural multiplicity (<i class="calibre1">les racines</i>), slipping back and forth between the categories of individual and collective. Its form is the <i class="calibre1">ratio studiorum</i>, a plan of study; through various lessons made available through its form and its processes, it teaches about competition, solitude, coexistence, sex, death, and the will to live. Furthermore, it reveals the limitations of knowledge:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Vient un moment</p>
        <p class="sl">Où les racines sont forcées</p>
        <p class="sl">De constater</p>
        <p class="slf">Que désormais</p>
        <p class="sl">Elles n’iront pas plus profond,</p>
        <p class="slf">Que de la terre, en somme,</p>
        <p class="sl">Elles ne pourront pas</p>
        <p class="sl">En savoir davantage.<a id="fn116r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn116">63</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon"><a id="p57" class="page1"></a>Profundity, as a figure for spatial depth but also as a figure for cognitive capacity, has limits. The root—as a real, botanical form and as a figure for knowledge—can only push so deep. No root has ever penetrated the surface on the opposite side of the world, through the molten core. Guillevic pushes the exercise further; the narrator in his poem takes the root as a set of instructions for how to live:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Façon de vivre:</p>
        <p class="sl">Se sentir englobé</p>
        <p class="sl">Par l’ensemble des racines. (106)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">That is, to re-implicate the human in the rhizosphere, an ecofigure for the world. The narrator expresses his alienation from the earth through a desire to live like a root:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Je ne demande qu’à entrer,</p>
        <p class="sl">À vivre comme vous,</p>
        <p class="sl">À me vivre racine. (106)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Throughout <i class="calibre1">Racines</i>, Guillevic probes the temporality of the root, what Michael Marder has recently called “plant time.” The temporal vocabulary—“Un jour/Beaucoup plus tard” (92), “tes heures” (94), <i class="calibre1">siècles, l’éternité, avenir, vite</i>, “l’éternité des temps,” “d’un moment de plus tard” (98)—hints at the fact that radical time is much slower than human time, which makes the world seem fast in comparison to it. The poet asks:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Entre le fossile</p>
        <p class="sl">Et le cadavre,</p>
        <p class="slf">Pour vous,</p>
        <p class="sl">Quelle différence? (96)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">For humans, centuries separate the fossil and the corpse. We feel a temporal proximity to the latter and a temporal distance from the former. But for the plant, which has a daily contact with both, gleaning nutrients from the cadaver and minerals from the fossil, the poet wonders if time is even “of the essence,” so to speak. Death is for the root a timeless precondition for its sustenance; without it, the root cannot live.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">From the beginning, Guillevic’s lyric economy shows an affinity with the economy of the root. The poetic voice recognizes in it bursarship (<i class="calibre1">l’économat</i>) <a id="p58" class="page1"></a>and stewardship (<i class="calibre1">l’intendance</i>). He also identifies in their growth process a kind of labor, a term particularly charged for Guillevic, whose Marxist sympathies are found just below the poem’s surface. He calls root growth an elaboration (103), a working out of form.<a id="fn117r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn117">64</a> I emphasize here the “labor” found in elaboration; growth is work:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Racines</p>
        <p class="sl">Elaborant le chêne</p>
        <p class="slf">Et vous élaborant</p>
        <p class="sl">Monument pour vous-mêmes.<a id="fn118r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn118">65</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">General work-related words like <i class="calibre1">travailler</i> and <i class="calibre1">travaux forcés</i> are combined with job-specific work vocabulary such as <i class="calibre1">distiller</i> or <i class="calibre1">malaxer</i>, which means to knead or mix. Throughout the poem, roots are transformed into laboratories and kitchens and other spaces of making.<a id="fn119r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn119">66</a> Guillevic’s Marxism creeps into the poem again here:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Comment est-ce</p>
        <p class="sl">Dans la terre</p>
        <p class="sl">La concurrence?</p>

        <p class="sl">Il n’y a pas</p>
        <p class="sl">Assez d’eau pour toutes.</p>
        <p class="slf">Quel est le règlement</p>

      </div>
      <p class="pcon"><a id="p59" class="page1"></a>How are resources distributed throughout the vegetal multiplicity? Which laws of competition govern underground? The narrator wonders hypothetically whether the root, in its ugliness, may be a figure of revolt against the trunk and foliage for which it provides (99). Without the root’s labor, after all, the tree has no chance of survival. Its noble verticality relies on the laborers, <i class="calibre1">les basses classes</i>, the true <i class="calibre1">agriculteurs</i> whose working of the land feeds the higher-ups. This pattern of the acknowledgment of workers’ exertions can even be seen in the angel-winged ant, the most industrious insect, that lands on the page, in possession of the truth from the subterranean factory, and who is summarily crushed:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">On se dit</p>
        <p class="sl">qu’elle vient de là-bas</p>
        <p class="slf">Et on l’écrase. (105)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">The crushed worker, the representative of what is low, dies under the thumb of a looming figure. The root is programmed by “a law of the earth” (“une loi de la terre”) to resist orderly straightness, refusing the rectitude of human-made forms like the straight Avenue de l’Opéra (93), one of the anti-barricade features of Haussman’s tactical Paris.<a id="fn120r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn120">67</a> Even the ownership of private property is done away with in the verses:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Les racines,</p>
        <p class="sl">Pas propriétaires</p>
        <p class="slf">De la furie</p>
        <p class="sl">Ni de la terre.<a id="fn121r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn121">68</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Roots become factories that run, rather than three eight-hour shifts, one twenty-four-hour shift:</p>

        <p class="sl">Plutôt le un vingt-quatre. (93)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Their life is nothing but work. In a humorous passage, the roots receive a call from the foliage asking for more titanium from their technical department (107). This is a clear reference not only to the comical buoyancy of Morgenstern’s poetry but also to his idea in “The Two Roots” of the treetops and roots communicating through some subtle channel:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">The whispers where the top leaves grow</p>
        <p class="sl">are echoed in the roots below.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Guillevic’s poem wonders, using military terminology, how the plant communicates with itself:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Avez-vous quelque chose</p>
        <p class="sl">Comme un téléphone de campagne?</p>
        <p class="slf">À l’état-major? (108)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Countless verbs in the future tense hint at the kind of wishful futurity involved in Leftist utopianism: <i class="calibre1">apparaîtra peut-être, accablera, aura, deviendront, pourront</i>, and so forth. When he writes,</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Dans les racines</p>
        <p class="sl">Il y a des aventures (92),</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Guillevic surely has in mind the etymology of adventure, <i class="calibre1">ad</i> + <i class="calibre1">venire</i>, or what is to come; he uses <i class="calibre1">avenir</i> specifically as well. Verbs of aspiration fill the verses: l’espoir (91), songer (90), réussir (91), donner envie (92), s’attendre à quelque chose (97). A figure of workers’ revolt, the root’s unruliness thinks forward in time to a placeless place, the utopia.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The network is a central problem in this poem and in any philosophical interrogation of rootedness.</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">S’improviser</p>
        <p class="sl">Un réseau de racines</p>
        <p class="slf"><a id="p61" class="page1"></a>Qui relierait entre elles</p>
        <p class="sl">Toutes les racines?<a id="fn122r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn122">69</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">This hypothetical question puts forth the idea of a fully integrated, universal root system to which all plants and trees are connected, something akin to the Matrix or the web. Michel Serres, in his well-known work on the problem of the network entitled <i class="calibre1">Hermes: Literature, Science, Philosophy</i> (1982), writes that the human is always caught at the junction of multiple, superimposed networks and that anyone who “fails or refuses to pass like everyone else through the crossroads of these multiple connections” is seen as an outcast.<a id="fn123r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn123">70</a> He continues: “Such is the case, for example, for whoever remains frozen, hung up, in the family tree, whoever fears leaving a closed paradise between two branches of a river, or whoever wants to tear apart the network which he endures as he would a prison or slavery’s iron shackles” (45). The human is necessarily a networked being, and this makes it easy to project onto the root’s bifurcations an image of systemic connectedness, a logistical wonderwork that incorporates every aspect of existence (sex, birth, death, nourishment, labor) into a single living image. But the root’s form is less reticular than vascular; it is less a grid than a flowchart. It doesn’t criss-cross like a net but instead provides paths of flux for water, minerals, and sap, each of which has a terminus. When the narrator addresses the root with this phrase—“Vous êtes/Comme des radiographies/De quelque chose en nous”<a id="fn124r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn124">71</a>—he notes the similarity between the vascular, neural, and neuronal forms in the human body seen in an X-ray and the root’s ramifications. But he also hints at the hidden something, the obscure “quelque chose,” that is less a physical form than a kind of ontological philosophy, a similar way of being between plant and person. Something in us is purely and secretly botanical.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Bachelard classified the root among subconscious figures of intimacy, and Guillevic takes up this claim, depicting the root as an erotic entity that penetrates, touches (<i class="calibre1">palper</i>), and makes love with the earth in the complicit darkness. Sexual expressions fill the poem: “amours avec la terre,” “un amant jamais comblé,”<a id="fn125r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn125">72</a> <i class="calibre1">pénétrer, noces, couple</i>, “se glisser en vous.” The root’s love is gluttonous. The poet proposes, as an innocent question:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf"><a id="p62" class="page1"></a>La terre,</p>
        <p class="sl">La racine—</p>
        <p class="sl">Un couple? (101)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">As I will show later, the notion of making love to the earth—which can be found, for example, in Michel Tournier’s novel <i class="calibre1">Friday</i>—involves an unbirthing of the human back into the land’s mother-womb. Sex is the attempt to reenter the solitude of a matricial beginning, to return to a primordial state of presocial and prepolitical life. This return is not a renaissance, but a pre-naissance. The watery, amniotic pouch in which life first stirs is not forgotten by Guillevic. Given his preoccupation with terraqueous forms, displayed in the title of his first poetry collection, <i class="calibre1">Terraqué</i>, the reader understands that the root is the ideal figure to pursue the thematic of earth-water symbiosis. Roots are aqueducts through which all water has passed:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Toutes les eaux</p>
        <p class="sl">Ont passé par vous,</p>
        <p class="sl">Racines. (101)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">The poet imagines that the best way to understand the root’s power of transubstantiation is to slip into it like a scuba diver:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">S’il suffisait</p>
        <p class="sl">De se glisser en vous</p>
        <p class="sl">Comme un scaphandrier</p>
        <p class="slf">Pour savoir comment</p>
        <p class="sl">Vous transsubstantiez (103)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">This strange image of embodiment, a self-contained figure slipping into the liquid sacrality of the root, shows the fluid penetration of one body into another.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There is other evidence of Guillevic’s residual Christianity, or his radically religious atheism, as Levertov put it. He mainly infuses the plant’s process of change with a mystical vocabulary, such as transubstantiation and apotheosis, which can mean “deification.”<a id="fn126r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn126">73</a> Processes of transformation, such as <a id="p63" class="page1"></a>distillation or the tree’s molecular making of an apple,<a id="fn127r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn127">74</a> are inexplicable and miraculous. The way the poet describes the plants’ eating and seduction of the earth resembles Simone Weil’s language of <i class="calibre1">nourriture spirituelle</i>. The roots believed their work would produce something like the Big Bang, not simply a trunk and foliage; they would have preferred to make something that lasted for eternity (97). Even in its ugliness,<a id="fn128r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn128">75</a> the root continues to spin out supernatural beauty in the form of flowers and leaves. The tree’s miraculous verticalization of water, whose defiance of gravity is made possible by the trunk, is only one of its many marvels. The theme of repetition, of constant and steady self-proliferation, depicts the root as an eternally engaged maker of miracles, repeating the process of life-making without needing instructions on how to do so. Making life is built into the genes of the plant; it is a botanical designer, a creator of sorts. The word <i class="calibre1">humus</i> (112), which links the human and the soil and is a very common word in the lexicon of rootedness, makes an appearance in the poem. The plant makes life from soil, just as the God of Genesis does.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre1">Racines</i> is a poem of reflexivity and reciprocity. It abounds with pronominal verbs, including reflexive, reciprocal, and idiomatic pronominal verbs: <i class="calibre1">se dire, se quitter, se connaître, se retrouver, se rencontrer, se faire, se refuser, se</i> <a id="p64" class="page1"></a><i class="calibre1">chanter, se glisser, s’enfoncer, se taire</i>. At times, it is difficult to tell whether the actions are being performed by the object on itself or mutually between two objects. The poem also includes several tonic personal pronouns attached to <i class="calibre1">même</i>, either as reflexives or emphatics: <i class="calibre1">toi-même, vous-mêmes, eux-mêmes</i>. All of this reflexivity and reciprocity shows the extent to which Guillevic is sensitive to the correlations between the natural world and the human-made one. The unsureness of a partnership between plant and person is communicated through terms of doubt (<i class="calibre1">probablement, peut-être</i>) and many interrogatives; the poetic voice asks exactly twenty-five questions in the poem. The poem, then, doesn’t know; it asks.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Of all the senses, sound is most emphasized in the poem. Bachelard cites Guillevic’s poem “Carnac” from <i class="calibre1">Terraqué</i>, which reads: “Les forêts le soir font du bruit en mangeant,”<a id="fn129r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn129">76</a> an image that recurs in <i class="calibre1">Racines</i>. Addressing the roots directly, the narrator suggests that silence is what they seek in the earth, but they create their own noise. Even in the oceans and rivers, the root has left its sonic signature:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Dans toutes les eaux</p>
        <p class="sl">On vous entend. (102)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">In one scene, the roots are depicted as so busy and making so much noise within their own bodies that they don’t hear the approaching mole, grubworm, or spade. But roots have no ears. They have no tongues to tell us what they know. Somehow, the radical otherness of the root is understood most starkly in its lack of communicative power with the human. We can neither talk to nor hear each other. The root becomes a figure of the incommunicable. No one can really speak about it nor on its behalf. The poet is committed to the idea of living like a root except for the fact of its silence:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Pour cela,</p>
        <p class="sl">Je suis prêt à tout.</p>
        <p class="slf">Sauf à me taire,</p>
        <p class="sl">Sauf à vous vivre sans le dire.</p>
        <p class="slf">Vivre sans dire</p>
        <p class="sl">Ce n’est pas vivre. (106–7)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon"><a id="p65" class="page1"></a>The poem closes with an enigmatic reference to the challenge of dialogue:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">On ne se quittera pas</p>
        <p class="sl">Comme ça.</p>
        <p class="slf">Il a fallu du temps</p>
        <p class="sl">Pour oser se le dire. (112)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">By addressing a presence that will never receive the message, Guillevic acts out the impossible ambition of real communion with the natural world. This chasm between humans and nature can be filled neither by words nor by actions. However, in contrast to Celan’s radical abyss, the abyss that makes an appearance in Guillevic’s poem remains a space of possibility and empathic projection:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Qu’est-ce qui se passe</p>
        <p class="sl">Pour une racine</p>
        <p class="slf">Quand elle débouche</p>
        <p class="sl">Dans l’air d’un abîme? (96)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">The narrator tries to imagine what it must be like as a root to encounter a cavity in the soil, which he takes as breathing room underground and a break in the dirt’s seeming infinity, a moment of difference within a far-stretching sameness. These gaps, called <i class="calibre1">galeries</i> toward the end of the poem, are aspirations, hopeful pockets of breath where the poet allows himself to imagine he has more in common with the root than he actually does. Plant empathy was also a feature of Ponge’s work; he imagined leaving the human world for the plant world and staying there forever.<a id="fn130r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn130">77</a> Poetry is one of the best places where the anxieties about our divorce from nature can be given voice. Guillevic shows an unalienated entity to which we may look as a model for incorporating ourselves into the earth. The root is a figure of haptic involvement in the world.</p>
