        <p class="crt">The fact is, man is an etymologizing animal. He abhors the vacuum of an unmeaning word. If it seems lifeless, he reads a new soul into it, and often, like an unskilful necromancer, spirits the wrong soul into the wrong body.</p>

      <p class="pf">The textual production of the Italian philosopher and mystic Lanza del Vasto (1901–1981) evinces a desire for a return to something lost by humanity. From <i class="calibre1">Imaginary Etymologies</i> and <i class="calibre1">The Code of Things</i>, to <i class="calibre1">Pilgrimage to the Source</i> and <i class="calibre1">Principles and Precepts of the Return to the Obvious</i>, del Vasto’s titles make obvious his feeling of urgency to return to an earlier state or to the fundament of all things in the universe. Del Vasto’s curious biography, a mystically infused life trajectory comparable in many respects to that of Simone Weil, led him to desperately seek solutions for the human suffering he witnessed during the turbulent twentieth century.<a id="fn372r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn372">3</a> In the introduction to del Vasto’s <i class="calibre1">Les etymologies imaginaires</i> (<i class="calibre1">Imaginary Etymologies</i>), published in 1985 after his death in 1981, Pierre Souyris argued that del Vasto forced connections between etymologically unconnected words, simply because of homographic or homonymic similarity.<a id="fn373r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn373">4</a> Souyris’s reservations about these etymological reveries sums up <a id="p181" class="page1"></a>a very old debate that was rehearsed anew during the course of the twentieth century. Can etymologies be trusted? And if so, of what use are they to us?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The debate over etymology allowed for the formation of several opposing camps. Even defining the term is a contentious affair, as Mario Alinei has shown by comparing thirty-five different definitions of it.<a id="fn374r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn374">5</a> For some, the attempt to pinpoint original meaning was approached as a highly scientific endeavor, with fringe linguists—fringe because etymology is generally marginalized as a pseudoscience even in the field of linguistics—trying to use as many resources as possible to declare with certainty a word’s genesis. Naturally, the tensions between “scientific etymology” and “folk etymology” erupted throughout the century, as public sentiment over the legitimacy of the field remained unstable.<a id="fn375r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn375">6</a> The more scientific-minded etymologists sought to wrest their discipline from the accusations lodged against it, namely that etymology is “anecdotal,”<a id="fn376r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn376">7</a> “quaint,”<a id="fn377r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn377">8</a> a “verbal pathology” (vii), a kind of “mischievous genius” (xxii), a “quasi-discipline,” a set of “intellectual fables” or “scholarly fictions of connection,”<a id="fn378r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn378">9</a> and a field that manifests “romantic amateurishness.”<a id="fn379r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn379">10</a> Some dismissed etymology altogether as a ridiculous fantasy with no bearing on the science of language, since it involves mainly anecdote and conjecture. Yakov Malkiel explains that etymology had little success as an “autonomous discipline, chiefly because it was associated with the reckless atomization of knowledge and, independently, because its pursuit was haunted, so rumour had it, by an excessive dosage of subjectivity and haphazardness.”<a id="fn380r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn380">11</a> Others <a id="p182" class="page1"></a>acknowledged etymology’s imprecision and lack of certainty, which, however, did not preclude an attempt to piece together a set of possible meanings using verifiable sources. They accepted their task as necessarily approximative but found it nonetheless significant. And for the most experimental thinkers, a relatively small cohort, etymology was seen as a creative practice, better suited for improvising new constellations of meaning than for locating old ones.<a id="fn381r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn381">12</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Etymology is not the only kind of linguistic interrogation that seeks origin in the idiom. Language, perceived as an organic cord between present and past, is a site of hope for a recuperable purity buried by time. In Europe and the United States in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century, an interest developed in tracing all metaphors and worldviews to their “ground metaphor” or “root metaphor,” which, according to Stephen Pepper, is determined primarily by common sense;<a id="fn382r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn382">13</a> in understanding the “mooring” or “grounding” of metaphor itself, as analyzed by M. Elaine Botha in her Christianity-focused book <i class="calibre1">Metaphor and Its Moorings: Studies in the Grounding of Metaphorical Meaning</i> (2007); or in identifying “absolute metaphors,” which Hans Blumenberg identified as those metaphors that are the “<i class="calibre1">foundational elements</i> of philosophical language.”<a id="fn383r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn383">14</a> These metaphors are more than mere rhetorical flourishes that could be easily replaced with other figurative expressions or done away with altogether. Philosophy relies on these metaphors, Blumenberg <a id="p183" class="page1"></a>argues, and philosophers should be cognizant that meaningful contemplation cannot happen without them, since they create the conditions of possibility for certain ideas. Other metaphor studies focus on their experiential origins. In other words, just as there are some who believe that signs are not arbitrary, there are those who believe metaphors are not arbitrary but are instead rooted primarily in bodily experience. These studies attempt to access the primordial human through a piecing together of the cognitive jumps that manifest themselves in language over time. Already in 1936, Julien Pacotte, in his book <i class="calibre1">Le réseau arborescent, schème primordial de la pensée</i> (The arborescent network, primordial diagram of thought), enumerates the treelike structures common to widely varying systems, such as mathematics, cytology, biology, chemistry, and physics, and argues that the omnipresence of the arborescent form is not merely a question of convention; ramifying networks are “a universal aspect of intimate reality. It is the very foundation of formal thought.”<a id="fn384r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn384">15</a> Thus language, including its “evolving” history of metaphors or words, develops according to an arborescent logic because thought itself is already formally treelike. We feel a particular intimacy with the tree and its form because our language and thought naturally conform to its bifurcating pattern.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">By no means was the twentieth century the first time etymology was considered a pursuit-worthy discipline. Perhaps in response to Barthes’s declaration that “a whole history of etymological science, of etymological philosophy, from Cratylus to Proust’s Brichot is yet to be written,”<a id="fn385r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn385">16</a> several impressive histories of etymology have appeared since the 1980s. I will not summarize those histories but want to make clear that Europe has been heavily invested in the self-conscious tracing of its lexical roots at least since antiquity. Later examples, such as Isidore of Sevilla’s famous seventh-century <i class="calibre1">Etymologiae</i><a id="fn386r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn386">17</a> (heavily relied upon by Aquinas, for example) and the ninth-century lexical encyclopedia <i class="calibre1">Etymologicum Genuinum</i> are among the best-known early European examples <a id="p184" class="page1"></a>of a systematic effort at etymological reconstruction. Throughout the centuries, etymology was alternately considered a philological science of the simple retracing of word roots, an exercise in interpretation (<i class="calibre1">expositio</i>), an amateurish and anecdotal act of trivia, and a creative and experimental practice meant to expose new possible ways of using language.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the twentieth century, thinkers and writers such as Valéry, Proust, Claudel, Heidegger, Agamben, and many others tended to look toward etymology as a kind of North Star with the power to orient the lost modern subject in a world that had forgotten its origins, now covered by centuries of historical debris.<a id="fn387r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn387">18</a> The etymological obsession is a strong example of the uniquely human <a id="p185" class="page1"></a>sentiment of indebtedness to the past.<a id="fn388r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn388">19</a> Feeling beholden to one’s ancestors manifests itself in the search for the oldest etymological roots, which are perceived to contain some power that could impact the present. Having much more than a casual interest in the history of language, many dedicated etymologists believed that the kernels of words could contain a primordial key to understanding something hidden about the human.<a id="fn389r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn389">20</a> By locating the <i class="calibre1">etymon</i>, we draw the ancestors near and implicitly ask them for advice on how to live and behave in the now. As Mario Alinei posits, “One could wonder whether the Indo-European short, monosyllabic form underlying English <i class="calibre1">I</i>, German <i class="calibre1">ich</i>, Latin <i class="calibre1">ego</i>, and Greek <i class="calibre1">eg</i><span class="calibre1">ṓ</span>, etc., could not be seen as a ‘primeval word,’ the original motivation of which could correspond to the awakening of individual consciousness, at the dawn of mankind.”<a id="fn390r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn390">21</a> Such an idea clearly pursues the biblical notion of the Word as synonymous with Creation. The uttering of “I” equals the creation of consciousness. There are those, known as Cratylists or naturalists, who support the idea of an original, authentic meaning of a word that is not arbitrary but has some unique and nonnegotiable connection with the thing it names. The term <i class="calibre1">Cratylism</i> derives from Plato’s <i class="calibre1">Cratylus</i> (fifth century BC), which stages a Socratic intervention in the debate between Hermogenes—who would today be called, like Saussure, a conventionalist, a believer in the arbitrariness of signs and in the powerful role of cultural convention in determining the names of things—and Cratylus, who argued for a nonarbitrary relationship between objects or people and their names. Although the definitive significance of the dialogue cannot be established with any certainty, Plato narrates a conversation that touches on questions with lasting relevance in the field of linguistics. This distinction between a naturalist and a conventionalist view of language largely determines a particular thinker’s <a id="p186" class="page1"></a>belief in the power of etymology. A naturalist would be much more seduced by the potential of etymological research to reveal the connections between things and their names. But if, as the conventionalist believes, these signs are arbitrary, why should etymology reveal anything aside from the haphazard pinning of names to phenomena? Saussure’s insistence in the twentieth century on the arbitrariness of signs gave a boost to the Hermogenic position. If signs are arbitrary, then tracing words back to their roots is a fruitless exercise, first, because accurate reconstruction is impossible and, second, even if the origin of an utterance could be tracked with certainty, it would not get us any closer to truth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The history of etymology in Europe can be considered through the standard polar optic of Hermogenism versus Cratylism, but the twentieth century added many fresh nuances to this old debate. For example, Gérard Genette, in his <i class="calibre1">Mimologics</i> (<i class="calibre1">Mimologiques: Voyage en Cratylie</i>, 1976), makes an important distinction between etymology and eponymy, a term, he argues, “that was missing for several centuries”<a id="fn391r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn391">22</a> and thus impeded a true understanding of Plato’s <i class="calibre1">Cratylus</i>. For him, the so-called etymologies in Plato’s text were in reality eponymies, which are much more indirect in nature.<a id="fn392r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn392">23</a> Genette argues that Plato “saw the trap. He also found the way out: the shift from indirect to direct motivation—that is, to sound symbolism.” As Thaïs E. Morgan writes in an introduction to <i class="calibre1">Mimologics</i>, “Whereas etymology aims to trace words back to their historical origins according to the laws of filiation, eponymy allows for imaginative free play” (19). Derek Attridge pursues Genette’s distinction, writing, “Word-play . . . is to etymology as synchrony is to diachrony.”<a id="fn393r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn393">24</a> Mario <a id="p187" class="page1"></a>Alinei has proposed another way of thinking about etymology; he argues that it should be divided into two subfields, etymography and etymothesis. The first would involve “the description and careful reconstruction of the context in which a transparent word has undergone a semantic development,” and the second would involve “speculations about the ‘origin’ of words” and “the reconstruction of the ‘etymon’ of opaque words.”<a id="fn394r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn394">25</a> Like Genette’s etymology-eponymy distinction and Attridge’s etymology–word-play distinction, Alinei seeks a terminology for the two primary ways an interest in word roots can be put into practice, either as a “scientific” method or as a more open-ended, speculative one.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The element of play introduced into the debate about the uses of etymology partly undoes the naturalist-conventionalist dichotomy by suggesting that etymologies, even false ones, have a potentially <i class="calibre1">creative</i> function. Here, poetics intervenes, and the etymologist-as-scientist is replaced by the etymologist-as-poet.<a id="fn395r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn395">26</a> Roots of words are no longer chains that bind us to the past but transform instead into bifurcating strands that lead toward new semantic possibilities. The poets and writers who implement etymology for aesthetic purposes are thus exempt from the allegation of bad science. Paul Beekman Taylor has noted what he calls an “etymological style” in early Germanic literatures, which “draws attention to significations beneath designations—<i class="calibre1">les mots sous les mots</i>—or to a word’s signifying source as well as to its signified sense.”<a id="fn396r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn396">27</a> Etymological poets like Mallarmé, Valéry, Claudel, Saint-John Perse,<a id="fn397r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn397">28</a> <a id="p188" class="page1"></a>Jean Cayrol,<a id="fn398r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn398">29</a> Francis Ponge, and Velimir Khlebnikov and prose writers like Roger Caillois,<a id="fn399r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn399">30</a> Michel Tournier,<a id="fn400r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn400">31</a> and Hélène Cixous<a id="fn401r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn401">32</a> use word roots as a loose remembering of past divergences in language. These divergences, forgotten or never known by contemporary users of the idiom, are recalled and recast to add dimensionality to the words on the flat page. As Ponge put it, etymology is the “poet’s most necessary science.”<a id="fn402r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn402">33</a> For him, the roots of words “seem a little like the trunks of words, like the knot of being, their hardest, mostsolid, and most essential part.”<a id="fn403r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn403">34</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Recently, the British writer Robert Macfarlane has taken on the ambitious project of “rewilding” the English language by recovering a lost lexicon of place, collecting forgotten terms throughout the United Kingdom that describe landscapes, qualities of light or weather, and the subtle configurations <a id="p189" class="page1"></a>of plant life. Of this project, titled <i class="calibre1">Landmarks</i> (2015), he writes, “I find lexicons to be more tropical jungle than tundra, gloriously ornate in their tendrilled outgrowths and complex root systems.”<a id="fn404r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn404">35</a> In Macfarlane’s efforts to resuscitate language, one recognizes the attempt to recontextualize the human in nature. He laments the replacement of a vocabulary of the wild with a vocabulary of the technical, illustrative of humanity’s divorce from nature. By recuperating the nature-centered lexicon of our forebears, we not only recover a lost genealogical connection; we also resituate the human in its original habitat. Macfarlane’s objectives are also aesthetic in nature. By salvaging old words, vocabularies are expanded and expression is enriched; poetry can move away from the general and toward the specific; regionality will mean something again; and the monotony of a standardized, universal vocabulary can be undone with a new, beautified, detail-oriented idiom.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus etymologies and the renewal of a weakened lexicon can serve both ideological and aesthetic purposes. One finds a particularly strong example of the blurring of the line between etymology as poetic flourish and etymology as argument in Paul Claudel’s etymological improvisations. Marie-François Guyard notes that in Claudel’s <i class="calibre1">L’art poétique</i>, poetry and philosophy are bound together through etymology.<a id="fn405r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn405">36</a> As I have shown, Claudel’s biblical exegesis looks everywhere for evidence to support his particular reading of the Bible and his interpretations of Christian doctrine. Therefore, as is to be expected, etymology is just one among many tools he uses to support these interpretations. In his book <i class="calibre1">Contacts et circonstances</i> (1940), Claudel even goes so far as to suggest that the Bible predicted the alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union at the dawn of World War II (the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact), basing this conviction on etymological proof.<a id="fn406r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn406">37</a> Guyard diagnoses Claudel as having a chronic case of what he calls “etymologitis” (<i class="calibre1">l’étymologite</i>),<a id="fn407r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn407">38</a> describing his etymologies as thorny (<i class="calibre1">scabreuses</i>) and stating unequivocally, “Claudel makes mistakes often and he does so in the name of an indefensible theory” <a id="p190" class="page1"></a>(286). And Claudel didn’t stop at just words; like Mallarmé and Rimbaud before him, he saw letters as magical units as well.<a id="fn408r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn408">39</a> In the end, Guyard concludes that Claudel was a bad philologist but a great poet, ultimately forgiving him for his overreaching etymological justifications.<a id="fn409r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn409">40</a> Mobilizing any means available, including strained readings into cryptographic <i class="calibre1">tableaux</i> and etymologies, Claudel tries to find proof in both word and image of Christianity’s truth, but ultimately he undermines the believability of these interpretations by pushing them to such a hyperbolic degree. His poetry, in its overemphatic Christian vehemence, can make the reader forget to read the verses as anything but relentless evangelism.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">However, Claudel’s poetic enlistment of etymology does highlight a signature metaphor attached to the discipline: that of the underground. As “ambassadors of a mute world,” in Ponge’s words, the poets are permitted if not encouraged to dig down deep into language.<a id="fn410r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn410">41</a> As Mario Alinei argues, “etymology addresses the realm of opacity,”<a id="fn411r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn411">42</a> that is, all that lies latent in the idiom. Depictions of etymological research tend to rely on a vocabulary of the subterranean. Robert Harrison, in his <i class="calibre1">Dominion of the Dead</i>, writes, “Dead etymons, latent meanings, and lateral connotations lie buried in the roots and phonemes of our living words, where they carry on an active afterlife.”<a id="fn412r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn412">43</a> Raimo Anttila compares the etymologist to an archaeologist,<a id="fn413r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn413">44</a> echoing Charles de Brosses’s term “archéologue universel.”<a id="fn414r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn414">45</a> Let us recall that Freud used a similar comparison—of psychoanalysis and archaeology—in the introduction to <i class="calibre1">Civilization and Its Discontents</i>, where he transforms Rome and its <a id="p191" class="page1"></a>architectural history into a “psychical entity,” the subconscious.<a id="fn415r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn415">46</a> Jean Paulhan describes the etymologist’s task as an imagined uncovering of the various layers that have concealed the word’s meaning over time.<a id="fn416r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn416">47</a> Railing against the etymological obsession, Jean Starobinski argues that the notion of the magic of an archaic word is nonsense,<a id="fn417r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn417">48</a> and he is equally suspicious of the subterranean and primal aspects of the internal psychic life so dear to Freud, hidden in notions like the archetype, “the archaic word (or event),” and beneath the “luxuriant undergrowth of Fable” (334). Gaston Ferdière, a French poet and doctor with close ties to the surrealists, conceptualizes what he calls a lexical “speleopsychology,” which entails an attempt at locating the subconscious origins of neologisms and, more specifically, <i class="calibre1">mots-valise</i>, or portmanteaus. He acknowledges the human temptation to dig for subterranean meanings in language.<a id="fn418r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn418">49</a> As a solution, he proposes the practice of speleopsychology:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">If at times portmanteau words are obvious, there is no need to conjure up the magic wand of some benevolent or malicious fairy to demonstrate this; it should be left only to the “speleopsychologists” (if you’ll allow me this neologism, which inscribes itself in the series of subterranean images encountered . . . from the pen of Michaux or Leiris) to seek the more or less distant “real origins,” in the midst of accrued difficulties; for the subconscious has its rock slides, its chaos, its air currents, its crawlways, like the world of Martel or Casteret [the recognized founders of French speleology, the scientific study of caves]. (174)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">In these depictions, language is spatialized and temporalized, composed of new strata that cover old ones. It is difficult to ignore the blatant phallic overtones of this linguistic penetration. If language is a composite of stratified <a id="p192" class="page1"></a>layers to be penetrated by the etymologist, then the secret knowledge imparted through the process equals a kind of possession.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The theme of subterranean penetration leads effortlessly to another trope common in texts about etymology: that of purity. The traceable <i class="calibre1">etymon</i> represents a recuperable virginity. Pure language, unsoiled by time and the defilements of accumulated meanings, is the gift that awaits the committed etymologist. Foucault, for example, leans on this metaphor in <i class="calibre1">The Order of Things</i> when he writes, “To bring the origin of language back into the light of day means . . . to rediscover the primitive moment in which it was pure designation.”<a id="fn419r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn419">50</a> The narrative of ethnic purity, which dominated European politics of the twentieth century, and the much older Christian ideal of purity—associated with virginity, bodily cleanliness, rectitude, virtue, and the rinsing away of sins—worked mutually at the exclusion of the foreigner and the nonbeliever. The two groups could be conflated as figures of the impure. Nonmastery of the language, then, meant a kind of linguistic rootlessness and could be extrapolated as a sign of impurity and impiety.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The notion of purity is consistent with another common metaphor of origin in etymological descriptions: the source. By depicting word roots as emanating from a source, the qualities of water—the most purifying solution—could be enlisted to offer a built-in reason for a return to the wellspring of language, namely its qualities as a cleansing solution and a quencher of thirst. Liquefaction of the idiom makes language necessarily bound to the idea of life itself, given that water is the vital elixir. The portrayal of the origin of language as a source implies that it sprang up as a wonder of nature and will continue to offer itself forth spontaneously, in a cleansing surge. Of Renaissance etymologists, Nancy Struever writes, “Their return to the sources, <i class="calibre1">ad fontes</i>, was . . . a ritual of purification.”<a id="fn420r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn420">51</a> Derrida reflects on the problems of source, origin, and purity by posing the question this way: What is the source of the source?<a id="fn421r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn421">52</a> <a id="p193" class="page1"></a>By pushing the question back far enough, one realizes that the trouble with origin-seeking is that it always defers to an even earlier origin, a sustained gesture of regress that leads to nowhere but the imagined Beginning.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Derrida’s reflections on the source lead to a final trope that is ubiquitous in the field of etymology: the metaphor of genealogy. In his well-known analysis “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” Foucault, motivated to respond to Paul Rée’s and Nietzsche’s writings on the problem,<a id="fn422r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn422">53</a> departs from the understanding of genealogy as the tracing back to some original source (of DNA, of moral or ethical first causes, etc.). Instead, Foucault argues that genealogy “opposes itself to the search ‘origins’”<a id="fn423r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn423">54</a> and that “a genealogy of values, morality, asceticism, and knowledge will never confuse itself with a quest for their ‘origins’” (80). If genealogy is not a search for origins, then what is it? It is the “analysis of descent” (81); in other words, it thinks in the opposite direction; it is not a search for the past but an endeavor that uses the past as a starting point to follow subsequent lineages, including the unrealized lineages that just as well could have been. Emphasizing the accident, the error, and other deviations, Foucault nuances the meanings of various origin-related words used by Nietzsche, such as <i class="calibre1">Ursprung, Entstehung, Herkunft, Abkunft</i>, and <i class="calibre1">Geburt</i>, in order to show that descent, not origin, is the primary interest of genealogy. Etymology, often understood as the genealogical research of a word, could be recast through Foucault’s analysis not as an attempt to locate an unfindable beginning but to analyze the concatenation of a word’s lexical lives. Of most interest are the <i class="calibre1">relationships</i> between bifurcating strands. The original, primordial syllable is of little consequence. However, Foucault’s emphasis on descent rather than origin has been historically ignored by most etymologists, particularly those who see high political stakes in their search for the primeval beginning.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">An etymology is a story, a <i class="calibre1">Bildungsroman</i> of the word. Because the names of things are bound to life itself (the Word of God, Adam’s engendering and naming of Eve, etc.), an etymology could be described as the biography of a word. Nancy Struever calls etymologies “stories describing <i class="calibre1">ur</i>-events of naming,”<a id="fn424r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn424">55</a> and she calls etymologists “narrators” (112). Derek Attridge poses the question: “What are etymologies if not stories? What is the model for the history of the word if not the biographical narrative?”<a id="fn425r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn425">56</a> Howard Bloch has <a id="p194" class="page1"></a>noted the tendency since the Middle Ages toward a genealogical logic applied to linguistic fields like etymology. He argues compellingly that “a genealogically defined linguistic model informs not only the discipline of grammar . . . , but remains fundamental to an entire epistemological mode manifest in the discourse of history, theology, and Biblical exegesis.”<a id="fn426r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn426">57</a> In a close reading of the thirteenth-century <i class="calibre1">La queste del Saint Graal</i>, he notes the importance of the tree as the symbolic locus of genealogical transmission: “The metonymically linked trees imply a system of relations in which every part is, through the seamless web of a lost beginning (an original wholeness at the outset of time), embedded in a hierarchical and chronological series. . . . The decision to begin with the tree which preserves an attachment to origin, and which binds within a single nexus both semiology and kinship, is hardly innocent. For the <i class="calibre1">lignum</i> so enmeshed with the ideas of lineage and language also serves to define the terms and parameters for our discussion” (33). He goes on to show the manifold ways in which language (and thus meaning) and bloodlines are constantly imbricated in medieval texts, heraldry, and other material vestiges of the period. The connection was by no means a new one,<a id="fn427r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn427">58</a> but it was revitalized in the Middle Ages and has remained a signature of European culture production ever since, although this link is largely overlooked today.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is unsurprising that we find these familiar root tropes—the subterranean, purity, the source, genealogy—applied to etymological roots. The root cannot be “thought” without them, whether as a word root, an ancestral root, or the roots of a nation. As shown in <a class="page1" href="part0008_split_000.html#ch01">chapter 1</a>, particularly in Bachelard’s and Jung’s analyses of the root as a metaphor, the figure is charged with many subconscious associations, but these in particular seem fixed in the collective psyche. Language, like other immaterial forms of transmitted culture such as <a id="p195" class="page1"></a>concepts, is given a connective form that is both living and hidden. As a hobby for devoted word-lovers, etymology does not seem particularly threatening. However, Nancy Struever has pointed to potentially dangerous applications of the discipline. Using a Foucauldian framework, she shows the frequency and magnitude of ideological deployments of word histories.<a id="fn428r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn428">59</a> Historically, etymology always went far beyond a leisurely pursuit of meanings for the sake of curiosity. The field, in varying degrees throughout history, has never been neutral or objective. “Etymology,” writes Struever, “can become the vehicle for disguised dogmas, for a race or folk wisdom, and thus etymologies become fables of irrationalist power” (111). I will show how, in France and Germany throughout the twentieth century, etymology was used to lay claim to certain cultural lineages perceived as superior to all others. It goes without saying that the strategists of national myth-making relied heavily on etymological proof. The search for the roots of language, conceived in vitalist terms and reliant on the metaphor of purity, fits comfortably alongside the twentieth-century programs in eugenics, national myth-making, Christianizing, and assimilation of colonial subjects as crucial enterprises for the preservation of Europe.</p>
