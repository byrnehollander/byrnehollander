      <div class="epigraph">
        <p class="crt">We shall follow [etymologies] to wherever the kin of a word under discussion is, even if it has driven its roots beyond its own territory. For often the roots of a tree which is close to the line of the property have gone out under the neighbor’s field.</p>

      <p class="pf">Because etymology is such a loose field, without a firm consensus on its methodology or even its objectives, it has proved particularly vulnerable to <a id="p196" class="page1"></a>ideological appropriation and to strong influence by concurrent sociopolitical happenings or by theoretical shifts in other disciplines. Germany became the primary home of etymological research in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Yakov Malkiel notes that by 1900, etymology had achieved a certain measure of legitimacy throughout Europe but was “reputedly a quintessentially German subdiscipline.”<a id="fn429r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn429">60</a> Already in the late nineteenth century, Darwinism began to impact the field of linguistics in Germany, influencing specialists to define the development of language in terms of fitness and to organize it in families with genealogical offshoots to newer, fitter families. The German linguist August Schleicher, with his text <i class="calibre1">Darwinism Tested by the Science of Language</i> (<i class="calibre1">Die Darwinsche Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft</i>, 1863), sought to show that the rules “which Darwin lays down with regard to the species of animals and plants, are equally applicable to the organisms of language.”<a id="fn430r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn430">61</a> It is not surprising that German linguists argued that their language was closest to Greek, “the language of philosophy,” and that their term for the family of languages to which most European languages belonged is still referred to in Germany as “Indo-Germanic” (which indicates the southeastern-most and northwestern-most borders of this language family), rather than the term “Indo-European,” whose use is widespread outside of Germany. Locating a possible <i class="calibre1">Urheimat</i> using etymological evidence was appealing to the proponents of National Socialism for obvious reasons. Gustaf Kossinna and Carl Schuchhardt, prominent specialists in prehistory, sought archaeological evidence of this <i class="calibre1">Urheimat</i> in the service of Nazi ideology. One can take the example of the swastika, chosen by the National Socialists as a symbol because of its “pure” Indo-Germanic history. Already in the 1870s, Heinrich Schliemmann offered evidence of this connection by calling the swastika an “exceedingly significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors,”<a id="fn431r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn431">62</a> noting that it was “already regarded, thousands of years before Christ, as [a religious symbol] of the very greatest importance among the early progenitors of the Aryan races” (101–2). The symbol was thus reappropriated solely because of its supposed “rootedness” in Indo-Germanic culture. Efforts at retracing symbols to their roots mirrored the endeavors of etymologists. Malcolm Quinn has argued that “the malleable, compliant and mute prehistoric artefact” was the perfect place to argue for Aryan supremacy because it could be manipulated and customized <a id="p197" class="page1"></a>at will.<a id="fn432r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn432">63</a> Quinn’s argument applies equally to etymology, a field that looks toward ultimately untraceable roots and often enlists its findings for ideological purposes. That “etymology is no innocent game”<a id="fn433r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn433">64</a> is particularly clear in the years between the <i class="calibre1">Belle Epoque</i> and the years shortly following World War II. If the Germans dominated the field of etymology at the turn of the century, it was that same perceived “Germanness” of the field that became a liability during and after the war years.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In 1909, with Rudolf Meringer’s founding in Heidelberg of the etymological journal <i class="calibre1">Wörter und Sachen</i>, a movement was established among Germanophone scholars that sought to study the connections between words and the material culture that influenced their coining. Proponents of the <i class="calibre1">Wörter und Sachen</i> movement attempted to bind meaning to something tangible rather than to speculative and often abstract etymologies disconnected from material culture.<a id="fn434r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn434">65</a> This emphasis on “the thing” and its relation to language anticipates a vocabulary used by Heidegger and the phenomenologists for interrogating the nature of being and its representation through language. In fact, from Heidegger’s claim that “the word makes the thing into a thing—it ‘bethings’ the <a id="p198" class="page1"></a>thing,”<a id="fn435r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn435">66</a> we might take a playful stab at creating a symmetrical formulation based on the tenets of the <i class="calibre1">Wörter und Sachen</i> movement: “The thing makes the word into a word—it ‘bewords’ the word.” Naturally, after World War I, the reputation of the discipline of etymology suffered, given its perceived bond with German scholarship. Malkiel argues that World War II impacted the discipline even more, with etymological researchers purposely seeking “non-Germanic, preferably Latin” roots to words to avoid attributing lexical origins to the proto-Germans. Etymology was thus politicized to an extreme degree, and various groups vied for a claim on originary, and thus formative, lexicological contributions. Malkiel makes an obvious but important observation: “Such an atmosphere, permeated by politically flavoured pro and contra sentiments, seems unhealthy for the growth of impartial etymological research.”<a id="fn436r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn436">67</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Any conversation about the ideological uses of etymology in Germany would be incomplete without mentioning Heidegger, the “Pablo Picasso of language,”<a id="fn437r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn437">68</a> whose etymological divagations have been the butt of many a joke.<a id="fn438r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn438">69</a> Like Claudel, Heidegger was accused by many of having contracted a rather serious case of etymologitis. Karl Jaspers describes Heidegger’s etymologism as the literalization of metaphors.<a id="fn439r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn439">70</a> Using etymology as a “probe,”<a id="fn440r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn440">71</a> his negotiation of the term <i class="calibre1">aletheia</i> in <i class="calibre1">Being and Time</i> is perhaps the most <a id="p199" class="page1"></a>cited example of this kind of experimentation. In an excellent summary of Heidegger’s etymologizing practice, George Steiner shows how Heidegger’s original use of etymology was to show in word roots “the greatest charge of initial and valid human perception,” but in his later use of it, he begins to mine language to demonstrate that “the occlusion of this meaning has altered and damaged the destiny of Western thought” (7–8). Critiquing Heidegger’s exceptionalization of Greek as a language unlike any other, as a language somehow more bound to original presence, Steiner continues: “In what way this assertion does no more than reproduce the allegories of Adamic speech and of Hebrew as we find them in Cabalistic and Pietist doctrines, and what conceivable means there could be of verifying Heidegger’s claims, are legitimate and, indeed, urgent questions. What we want to know now, however, is just where this ‘etymologizing realism’ is taking us. The answer is: to yet further etymologies, which Heidegger’s critics hold to be wildly arbitrary” (24–25). Steiner is right to identify the similarities between Heidegger’s conception of language and Adamic speech. This account of linguistic beginnings allows him to nurse his attraction to the Mystery. Because others have already analyzed the numerous inaccuracies in Heidegger’s etymologies, I will not do so here. Instead, I will only mention in passing that it is not surprising at all to find Heidegger turning to the primal origins of words to make his case about the uprootedness of modern life. Primordial word roots have the same appeal for him as the notion of autochthony, so central to his “Memorial Address” and to his earlier thinking about the relationship between people and their place of origin. As I have shown using the example of his literalization of the term <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>, Heidegger makes a habit of dusting off the particulate meanings that have collected over the centuries on words and ideas. His search for a primordial tongue is in keeping with his attempts to show the impact of the <i class="calibre1">Heimat</i> on cultural production. The authentic and the primal are for him coequal. Again, his etymological liberties attempt to make a case for the ancestral connection between Germany and Greece, and, as in his arguments about original autochthony, he relies on a mystical vocabulary of the primeval moment. Derek Attridge draws up a philosophical genealogy of how etymologies have been used by well-known thinkers, positing that “Vico and Heidegger may sound more like de Brosses and Tooke in their earnest search for ‘authentic’ meanings, whereas Plato’s and Derrida’s ironies play freely through their writing.”<a id="fn441r" class="fnref" href="part0013_split_006.html#fn441">72</a> This distinction—between thinkers who themselves, in their use of etymology, truly believed in primordial authenticity and those who sought to play with the <a id="p200" class="page1"></a>potential meanings of words—ultimately dissolves when their etymologies are recontextualized, reappropriated, and repurposed by later thinkers who cite these etymologies as truth.</p>
