        <p class="aubiof"><a class="page1"></a>Writing means having a passion for origins. It means trying to go down to the roots. The roots are always the beginning. Even in death, no doubt, a host of roots form the deepest root bottom. So writing does not mean stopping at the goal, but always going beyond.</p>

      <p class="pf"><a class="page1"></a>One of the most lasting contributions of Bachelard’s <i class="calibre1">oeuvre</i> was his willingness to take poets seriously, considering literature to be as valid a place as dream analyses or patient testimonies to find evidence of the psyche’s inner workings. Bound by few strictures, poetry has tacit permission to access the impressions and intuitions of an attentive subject through imagery and aesthetically conscious language. These impressions, when considered jointly and severally, begin to give a sense of the conscious and subconscious significance of a particular metaphor. Often, a poem is the vanguard of an idea that will take hold in the collective consciousness, creating the conditions under which something new can be said outside literature.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Given the flexibility of the root metaphor, poets commonly turn to it when writing about home, exile, longing, attachment, spirituality, sexuality, nature’s will, familial ties, memory, and the underground. For example, the Martinican poet Aimé Césaire’s <i class="calibre1">Notebook of a Return to the Native Land</i> (<i class="calibre1">Cahier d’un retour au pays natal</i>, 1939), is an extended, visceral interrogation of rootedness expressed through the voice of a population pulled between Africa, the Caribbean, and France.<a id="fn54r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn54">1</a> Rainer Maria Rilke’s <i class="calibre1">The Book of Hours</i> (<i class="calibre1">Das Stunden-Buch</i>, 1905) uses roots to describe the slow, burgeoning relationship with God. In Antonin Artaud’s “Here Lies” (“Ci-Gît,” 1947), the family tree is bent into a corrupted closed circuit in which the narrator becomes his own son, <a id="p39" class="page1"></a>father, and mother. And Yves Bonnefoy uses the imagery of forest undergrowth to convey the notion of primordial memory in his poem “A Voice” (“Une voix,” 1958). In these poems and many others, the root becomes the optic through which the problem of connectedness—to homeland, to god, to family, to the past—can be seen and subtly refashioned.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">While it would be impossible and unavailing to catalog the innumerable conspicuous uses of the root metaphor in twentieth-century poetry, I’ve identified four poets whose quintessential application of it push the figure in new directions that give insight into the questions I pose in this book. These poets are Francis Ponge, Paul Celan, Eugène Guillevic, and Denise Levertov. Ponge is more interested in the plant as a whole than roots specifically; but when he does write about them, they are figures for immobility, one of the primary distinctions between the human and the plant. Root imagery recurs prominently in Paul Celan’s poems and, in the most salient appearances, is a figure for absolute negation, of a family lineage and of a people. Eugène Guillevic, in his celebration of regional rootedness, uses the root as an occasion for launching thought experiments about time, death, the subterranean world, and vegetal will. Denise Levertov, a British-born American poet, did not publish poetry in French or German, but she was heavily influenced by both Celan and Guillevic. I see in Levertov’s work a transformation of these two poets’ renderings of the root into a figure for ecological alienation.</p>
