      <p class="pf">As World War II showed the magnitude of its violence, two thinkers, one from France and one from Germany, attempted to draft a vision of how the wrongs of Europe could be rectified. Out of disillusionment, they turned to figurative language. And both authors chose metaphors depicting the human as plant: the first was Simone Weil’s notion of rootedness or “en-rootment” (<i class="calibre1">enracinement</i>) and the second, Martin Heidegger’s notion of groundedness (<i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>). The philosopher and factory worker Weil argues in her book <i class="calibre1">The Need for Roots</i> (<i class="calibre1">L’enracinement</i>, published posthumously in 1949) that World War II was caused by a collective loss of roots. To have roots, she explains, means to participate in a given community, to actively venerate the treasures of the past, and to become a steward of the future. In her view, the decay of moral, intellectual, and spiritual roots may be caused in part by military conquest, the obsession with money, and an education system that disregards Europe’s forebears the Greeks. Her Marxism and Christian mysticism are manifest in her insistence on a personal, spiritual investment in physical labor, an essential step toward the regrowth of roots. Weil’s example clearly reinforces the connection between rootedness and transcendence established in <a class="page1" href="part0010_split_000.html#ch03">chapter 3</a>. She literalizes the root metaphor by emphasizing the importance of land ownership, not in the nationalist sense—to own specifically French soil—but as an obligation and privilege to become a custodian and involved resident of the earth. I argue that Weil’s biggest fear was not war, Nazism, urbanization, industrialization, or a collective drift away from God; her supreme fear was abstraction. In Weil’s vision, to be uprooted meant to live in a world guided increasingly by abstract principles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><a id="p112" class="page1"></a>For Heidegger, on the other hand, his preoccupation with groundedness could not be more politically identarian. As I was writing this book, the new volume of his <i class="calibre1">Black Notebooks</i> was published, refueling the debate over the extent of his anti-Semitism and to what degree it had informed his philosophical thought. The blatantly anti-Semitic passages in the third volume have made it impossible to claim that Heidegger was a victim of circumstance or that his philosophy was not heavily influenced by his politics. In his 1955 text <i class="calibre1">Gelassenheit</i>, he explores and reframes the notion of <i class="calibre1">Bodenständigkeit</i>, translated often as groundedness or rootedness, which confirms again the link between stability down below and transcendence up above in Western thought.<a id="fn213r" class="fnref" href="part0011_split_004.html#fn213">1</a> While his earlier obsession with <i class="calibre1">Heimat</i> (homeland) and regionally specific groundedness had the obvious nationalist overtones of right-wing (eco-)politics, his reformulation of the notion attempts to address the new reality of the modern age, namely that many Germans fled during and after the war and those who remained were in a sense always drawn elsewhere by television and radio. He saw technology as inimical to a sense of groundedness in the world. In this chapter, I show how Heidegger’s appeal for the human to be put back in its place follows the same logic as the French concept of <i class="calibre1">terroir</i>, which combines agricultural science and regional <i class="calibre1">chauvinisme</i>. The belief that land leaves its signature on agricultural products and on people becomes a philosophical justification for entitlement to a specific parcel of land. The terrestrial nostalgia involved in <i class="calibre1">terroir</i> follows the same logic as the regionalist effusions of Maurice Barrès’s <i class="calibre1">Les déracinés</i>. Heidegger, Weil, and Barrès rely on a restorative poetics, conveying through retrophilic language that the better past is recuperable.</p>
