      <p class="pf">The American poet Denise Levertov (1923–1997) considered both Celan and Guillevic among the great poets whose “[darkness] must be within them. It’s a question of weight.”<a id="fn131r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn131">78</a> In the late 1960s, she published her translations of some of Guillevic’s poetry into English, and she also wrote a late poem called “Thinking about Paul Celan,” in which she calls him</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Saint Celan,</p>
        <p class="sl">stretched on the cross.<a id="fn132r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn132">79</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">She published a poem in 1982 that conveys the impossibility of rerooting, particularly the sort envisioned by Simone Weil and Martin Heidegger, which is analyzed in detail in <a class="page1" href="part0011_split_000.html#ch04">chapter 4</a>. As a bridge figure whose root poem hovers somewhere between Celan’s and Guillevic’s, Levertov discerns the human’s propensity to deracinate itself from the earth, which created the conditions of its very existence. Dorothy Nielsen, who describes some of Levertov’s work as “antianthropocentric,” claims that these poems are marked by a sensitivity to a specifically Hasidic ontology.<a id="fn133r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn133">80</a> Levertov was influenced by Martin Buber’s work, even borrowing his signature “I-Thou” in her poem “The Cat as Cat.” In <i class="calibre1">I and Thou</i>, Buber stages a reciprocal contact between human and tree, <a id="p67" class="page1"></a>making the two equals in their taking account of each other.<a id="fn134r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn134">81</a> Nielsen argues that Levertov’s ecological poetry evinces her “belief that nonhuman entities are presences rather than objects politically as well as poetically.”<a id="fn135r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn135">82</a> Despite her appreciation of Guillevic’s poetry, she resisted his tendency to project upon the tree the kind of subjectivity he grants it.<a id="fn136r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn136">83</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Levertov may have had Celan’s radical abyss and Guillevic’s poetry of radical trying in mind when she wrote these verses titled “Re-Rooting”:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">We were trying to put the roots back,</p>
        <p class="sl">wild and erratic straying root-limbs,</p>
        <p class="sl">trying to fit them into the hole that was</p>
        <p class="sl">cleancut in clay, deep but not</p>
        <p class="sl">wide enough; or wide but too square—trying</p>
        <p class="sl">to get the roots back into the earth</p>
        <p class="sl">before they dried out and died.</p>
        <p class="sl">Ineptly we pulled and pushed</p>

        <p class="sl">struggled to thrust it back not into sinuous corridors</p>
        <p class="sl">fit for its subtleties, but obstinately</p>
        <p class="sl">into an excavation dug by machine.</p>
        <p class="sli"><a id="p68" class="page1"></a>And I wake,</p>

      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Through a lexical field of natural wetness (rivers, arteries, sap, ebb), she depicts the human as a shriveling form, drying up after its own withdrawal from the source. The human, unlike the root, extricates itself from its ground. Even with tools made for digging or re-implantation, the human can only clumsily attempt to put itself back in the notch it deserted. The people, seeing themselves as godlike, are destined to fail in their imitations of creation’s intricate bonds. The tension between human self-extrication and the intricacies of nature’s original forms hinges on this syllable “-tric,” which implies the <i class="calibre1">tricae</i>, or entangled perplexities or tricks and turns, simultaneously inimitable and inescapable. Restoration of an original implication, an enfoldedness in the soil, is impossible. Levertov’s poem puts a global “we” at odds with itself as it looks where it was, knowing it can never go back. The impossible return plays out in the poem through verbs such as “trying” and “striving.” The obstinate ineptitude with which the species attempts to reintegrate itself, trying to dig back in as artfully as the roots, shows that it can be nothing if not awkward in the world. George Steiner has used the expression “penitential ecology” to describe the guilt-induced human exertion to undo its own environmental damage.<a id="fn138r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn138">85</a> This existential awkwardness seems incurable, since even the gouging out of a provisional space—“better than nothing”—is only a dream vision. The human is simply an ill fit for the planet. The heavy indentation of the poem’s last stanza creates the unfillable gap between the work the narrator imagined was happening (for lack of a better solution) and the actual nonwork that keeps humans from even bothering to try. Can you imagine trying to refit an uprooted tree perfectly in its old ground, placing each root filament in its proper place? The task is impossible.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Levertov depicts the root in one of its most important iterations: a figure of mourning for a lost connectedness with the planet.<a id="fn139r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn139">86</a> When she wrote, “Deforestation <a id="p69" class="page1"></a>is a kind of protracted trench-warfare,”<a id="fn140r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn140">87</a> she portrayed a species at war with itself and with the planet. As Gregory Bateson famously put it, “The creature that wins against its environment destroys itself.”<a id="fn141r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn141">88</a> The uprooting or razing of the forests is not a distinct problem from human self-eradication. If people so readily botanify themselves, thinking and living as rooted creatures, how can a tree torn from its ground not elicit some kind of irritation in the person who watches it? Why this particular limit of the imagination? Ecologically inflected philosophies support the notion of a plant-human symbiosis and thus consider the irresponsible felling of a tree nearly as serious as an assault on another human, as Levertov did. The human who uses the world’s resources without following what seems to be nature’s rule of taking only what is needed—I have yet to see a morbidly obese tree—goes against nature, decadently <i class="calibre1">à rebours</i>, and is destined to die. The root <i class="calibre1">cadere</i>, “to fall,” is found in the word <i class="calibre1">decadent</i>, used today in commercials to sell luxury chocolate or other forms of excess. We are regularly invited to decline through overabundance.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A fascinating example of the kind of ecological severing that Levertov describes can be found in the early-twentieth-century botanical photos by the German photographer Karl Blossfeldt. There are few better cases of technology used to paradoxically celebrate and destroy nature, thus marking the ever larger rift between humans and the natural world. One of the most significant aspects of the root is its usual unseen-ness. At least in the Western world, the tree as a whole suffers from a general invisibility because of its vast proliferation in most populated areas; there are so many, we cease to see them.<a id="fn142r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn142">89</a> But the root is more literally hidden, which means that for the human, it is in many <a id="p70" class="page1"></a>ways the most neglected part of the plant. When asked to draw a tree, a person is likely to leave the roots out, considering only its visible parts as integral to it.<a id="fn143r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn143">90</a> The root’s problem of low visibility arises again and again in the body of texts studied here; it is unsightly in more ways than one. Something about its omission from our field of vision makes it all the more enticing as a screen upon which to project fanciful ideas about it. In the early twentieth century, Blossfeldt, a central figure of the <i class="calibre1">Neue Sachlichkeit</i> (New Objectivity) movement in photography, attempted to make people see the plant again, but not its roots. His botanical images show a wide variety of immaculate and nearly architectural forms in the plant world, suggesting that all forms of human-made beauty drew their inspiration from these paradigmatic forms. In his <i class="calibre1">Urformen der Kunst</i> (literally, “<i class="calibre1">Original art forms</i>,” but translated as <i class="calibre1">Art Forms in Nature</i>, 1928), black and white photographs show in detail the beautiful symmetries and contours of various species of plants, singling out an individual stem, bud, or pod and highlighting the forms that artists have borrowed for their furniture, bridges, and cathedrals. In an introductory essay to the collection, the art collector Karl Nierendorf writes that all the features of European architecture through the ages “trace their original design [<i class="calibre1">Urbild</i>] to the plant world.”<a id="fn144r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn144">91</a> But in Blossfeldt’s large corpus of botanical photographs, no roots are to be found. Clearly, the root’s riotous form and unclean lines were incompatible with his aesthetic vision of pure form. He was attracted instead to the parts of nature that looked <i class="calibre1">designed</i>. This leads to an important observation about the root’s unsightliness: it does not resemble the craftsmanship of an artisanal god. One could imagine that Mother Nature herself hid the root underground because its ugliness was too overwhelming to bear. What is ugly <a id="p71" class="page1"></a>is cropped from memory and perhaps consciousness. Nature is not uniformly beautiful, contrary to our wishes.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We might call Blossfeldt’s photos “plant portraiture,” since they treat the plant photographically like a human subject who has come to pose in the studio. But for these photos to happen, the plant had to be torn from its habitat, a fact denied by Blossfeldt’s omission of the roots or other evidence of this tearing. The minimalism of his photographs, which show plants plucked from their context and put on display before a neutral backdrop, refuses the natural world’s will to contextualize. In nature, context is everything. All natural life belongs to a finely tuned ecosystem; only the human has unsituated itself, bringing some other species along with it through domestication. Nierendorf takes a celebratory position toward new technologies and claims that they bring us closer to plants.<a id="fn145r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn145">92</a> He even implies that new technologies like “mechanical buildings, motor-cars, aeroplanes, as well as the film, the radio, and photography” (6) are extensions of the same creative evolution that led people to imitate plant forms subconsciously in architecture. These technologies are simply examples of “the creative spirit manifesting itself in new forms” (6). From this perspective, modernity is not at odds with nature. On the contrary, the same <i class="calibre1">élan créateur</i> that impels plants to improvise their elegant forms manifests itself in all that is made by the human. In short, technological developments are extensions of the botanical creative force. The vegetal element of ourselves manifests itself in the forms we reproduce, imitative of their already mastered masterpieces.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This presents a strange paradox: if Blossfeldt’s camera is the next phase in a creative evolution of which plants were the earliest step, it also destroys plants in order to do its work. Nierendorf saw in the images a step toward the realization of “a new unity in all spheres of Life, of Art and of Technics” (8), but this kind of unity preserves the plant only as a dead index, not as a living entity. The real plant was killed for art’s sake. With his title <i class="calibre1">Urformen der Kunst</i>, Blossfeldt suggests that plants provide the <i class="calibre1">Ur-</i>forms of art, that for any form the artist can imagine, nature has already provided the prototype. Yet, <a id="p72" class="page1"></a>by cutting up the plants and leaving the roots out of the frame, he ruptures the continuity implied between contemporary forms and their primeval paradigms. Through these photographs, several common associations of rootlessness come together. To be rootless is to lack context. It involves the anxiety of being the only species that can maintain memory from one generation to the next, that can create technologies to destroy all other species, that can dramatically alter ecosystems for its own benefit. This rootlessness can take the form of an ecological alienation, with people fearing their permanent exile from nature. It can take a social form, in which the rootless individual cannot be integrated into a polity, a community, a family, or some other form of social organization. It can also take form as an existential rootlessness; postmodernism, for example, is often imagined as the reaction to a feeling of historical placelessness, a lack of real understanding of traditions, and a break in cultural continuity. In the digital age, the preference for the impalpable over the palpable has contributed to this existential rootlessness. And contemporary irony, especially in its most hyperbolic forms, often relies on the absolute subversion or deletion of context.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Denise Levertov’s “Re-Rooting” describes beautifully the ways that technology—in the form of the camera, the trench-digger, the pesticide—has decontextualized the human, giving the impression that all problems can be solved through scientifically informed mechanisms, yet doing nothing to alleviate the generalized sense of alienation. The plants in Blossfeldt’s pictures are beautiful, preserved in time as indexical images, deracinated and emptied of life. Once they are extracted, it is impossible to imitate nature’s original contextualizing genius. In contemporary life, as we collectively try to “put the roots back,” we realize that our collective energies are spilling out and that our tools and toys are of little use to us in conserving them. Poetry might very well be the best medium for expressing uprootedness as the increasing absence of context, giving a language to what photography can only display wordlessly.</p>
      <p class="sec">*</p>
      <p class="pf">Four poets, four distinct roots. Ponge, in his openness to let the plant change his mind and by turning his object of study this way and that, trying to think through the plant’s own experience of the world, sees clearly what distinguishes it from the human. People are nomads in comparison to the plant. Do we really want what the plants have? Would we rather have the world come to us? In our increasingly vegetative state, in which we access the remote world through a screen, we have taken on something of the plant’s existence, which <a id="p73" class="page1"></a>requires everything to come to it. But these images and sounds are only simulacra; were we to put a tree in an IMAX theater showing the film of a forest, the tree would not recognize this world as its own. The kind of embeddedness the plant requires in order to thrive cannot be replaced by images. Our artificial vegetative life might seem to want to make stillness a virtue, but it is the ultimate paradigm of decontextualization. The trees’ immobility is what turns forest into context. In the case of Celan, while I believe his poem is an attempt to reconcile through poetry the gap between what should have come to pass and what actually did, it conveys much of the same longing as Levertov’s ecological elegy, which tries to fill an absence with presence. Celan wants to wake up from his nightmare; Levertov wants her dream to continue. But in both cases, there is this unappeasable hole, the “o” in Celan’s page or the awkwardly shaped hole—“deep but not/wide enough; or wide but too square”—in that of Levertov. Guillevic’s root is content with its vocation as root, which it lives as such; pushing through the terrestrial darkness is the root’s calling. It is pure will in botanical form. If there is a hole in his poem, it is the communicative breach that separates plant from person. We will never know what the plant knows. While the poet longs to be more rootlike, this is more of a thought experiment—“How would it feel to be more radical?”—than an ardent wish. In this sense, his hypothetical question resembles Ponge’s essayistic treatment of the plant. To a greater extent in Guillevic’s poem than in the others’ works, the human and the root are mapped onto one another as entities with similar bodily and intellectual needs and wants. A certain harmony between plant and person can be found in his verses. But there is a risk to the literalization of plant-human metaphors. A marked difference exists between loving land and loving a specific plot of land. The celebration of the homeland in a regionalistic or nationalistic way can very easily tip over into a politically dangerous, proprietary miserliness, which was the case, for example, in Germany under the National Socialist regime. In many contexts, it is difficult to use the word <i class="calibre1">Heimat</i> without triggering images of genocide. The latent political implications in the root poems of Celan, Guillevic, and Levertov all point toward very real instances of twentieth-century brutality, exploitation, land-worship, and land-devastation. In the following chapter, I show how European culture relies on the belief that transcendence in most of its forms is predicated on a firm rootedness. A tree’s verticality is owed to its underground reinforcement.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These twentieth-century poets have illustrated the wideness of the root’s perimeters as a metaphor. Botanical immobility captured the imagination of Ponge; by thinking through it as a hindrance and a gift, he showed the limits to the human desire to imagine the self as a plant. Paul Celan and Eugène <a id="p74" class="page1"></a>Guillevic both invest the figure with potent symbolic power but in nearly diametrically opposed ways. Celan’s root is dead—or, better, <i class="calibre1">void</i>. It is an almost total abstraction, a figure for what is virtually unsayable and the nonform of a future that will not come to pass. Guillevic is much more of a literalist, speaking of what the reader might imagine as a very real root that becomes the departure point for a series of thought experiments staging an empathic encounter between person and plant. His root is very much alive, and anthropomorphically so, becoming alternately a worker, a cook, and a lover. Denise Levertov, an avid reader of both Celan and Guillevic and familiar with Ponge’s poetry, crafted a poem about the ontological awkwardness of the human in the natural world, trying to replant itself back in the environment to no avail. Rootlessness as a metaphor for ecological alienation is one of the most widespread of its uses in the twentieth century. Having cut the umbilical cord from Mother Nature and possessing the mental capacity to realize it, we find each day in the news evidence of the graceless attempt to reverse this severing. But, as in the case of the person who looks at the plant’s immobility with a kind of pity, there is a secret gladness in our independence from nature. The secession of culture from nature, the great Cartesian split, has perhaps fatigued the human who senses but cannot repair this uprooting. People take themselves willingly out of context more and more.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Indeed, the four poets show that, perhaps above all else, people desire a context on which they can depend. Context means wovenness into a phenomenon, be it nature, family, or history. This is what Ponge finds appealing in the immobile plant; it is absolutely never out of context. For Celan, context means maintaining a position in a centuries-old lineage and in an ineradicable culture. For Guillevic, the plant’s active self-investment in its vocation and its habitat make it the ultimately contextualized entity. And for Levertov, to be contextualized is not to look at nature from outside it like an awkward voyeur but to have never stepped outside it. When anything is taken out of context, it is inevitable that meaning will be lost. These questions continue in the next chapter, in which I introduce the idea of rooted transcendence. In the Western imagination, no one can transcend without roots.</p>
