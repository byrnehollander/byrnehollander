      <p class="pf">The root is both an organizing image used by the subconscious and perhaps the most compelling figure <i class="calibre1">for</i> the subconscious. With its moisture, silence, darkness, minerals, and subterranean creatures, the rhizosphere is the home of the root and a kind of follicle or life-sustaining pouch. This subterranean home places the root in the archetypal category of the underworld. As a bridge between the Chthonic (the underworld) and the Uranic (the celestial), the tree, whose roots bury themselves in the earth and whose branches reach toward the heavens, has a privileged place in the human imagination as a sort of communicating vessel between the terrestrial world and the godly firmament. The imagined symmetry of the tree above and below ground transforms it into a kind of verticalized Rorschach test; our discernment of particular patterns in this symmetry and our interpretation of it says much more about us than it does about the tree. Roots are generally seen as the tree’s stabilizing mechanism, the way it holds itself in place. But roots also prevent erosion by clutching the soil and holding it together. Metaphorically speaking, our roots keep us from losing ground.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If the subconscious is below, it shares this subterranean world with the root. Jung saw trees as “direct embodiments of the incomprehensible meaning of life”—which explains their importance in many of his most significant writings on archetypal imagery.<a id="fn21r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn21">18</a> When he prepared a Festschrift for the seventieth birthday of the botanist Gustav Senn at the University of Basel, the theme he chose was the philosophical tree. In an expanded version of it, Jung shows the way the tree has been represented symbolically throughout history and how the inner experiences of his patients align perfectly with this cosmic pattern. He is careful to note that “none of the patients had any previous knowledge of alchemy or of shamanism,”<a id="fn22r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn22">19</a> to underscore his argument that the human psyche has a universal archetypal structure into which all people are plugged, whether they have been schooled in the occult or not. The tree—roots included—is one of the fundamental images the human uses to make <a id="p25" class="page1"></a>sense of the world. Something about its elementarity and aliveness has encouraged philosophers, poets, and mystics throughout the centuries to use it as a screen onto which they can project any number of conceptual experiments.<a id="fn23r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn23">20</a> The “wonder-working plant”<a id="fn24r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn24">21</a> takes form throughout history as the Edenic Tree of Knowledge and Tree of Life, the Burning Bush in the Old Testament and the Torah, the larger-than-life Yggdrasil in Norse cosmology, the Christmas tree, the <i class="calibre1">Donareiche</i> of the Germanic pagan tradition, the sacred tree of Uppsala in Sweden, the Sephirotic Tree or the <i class="calibre1">Etz haChayim</i> (Tree of Life) found in the Kabbalah, the Ashvattha or Sacred Fig in Hindu mythology, and mystical trees in countless other traditions across the globe. In his 1976 book of poetry titled <i class="calibre1">Arbres</i> (Trees), Jacques Prévert melds magic and the tree in the clever portmanteau “Abracadabrarbre.”<a id="fn25r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn25">22</a> A tree is used in some cultures to represent the <i class="calibre1">axis mundi</i>, or the universal center where heaven and earth meet. Jung identifies numerous patterns that crop up in relation to the tree as archetypal image, noting that “the commonest associations to [the tree’s] meaning are growth, life, unfolding of form in a physical and spiritual sense, development, growth from below upwards and from above downwards, the maternal aspect (protection, shade, shelter, nourishing fruits, source of life, solidity, permanence, firm-rootedness, but also being ‘rooted to the spot’), old age, personality, and finally death and rebirth.”<a id="fn26r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn26">23</a> The root, that hidden twin tree underground, possesses most of these qualities in its own right, except the power to bear fruit or provide shade and protection. Jung cites the French poet Noël Pierre’s poem “Soleil noir” as an “authentic experience of the unconscious” (270) that depicts the “universal midpoint of mankind” and “the heart as the centre of man’s vitality in conjunction with the tree” (271):</p>

      <p class="pcon">Jung’s interest in this passage is due mainly to its power of synthesis. In one short text, Pierre manages to fuse many of the tropes that surround the root: its role as a kind of self-emanating center, its fluvial form and intimate connection with water, and its solitude and separation from the above-ground world. The root, as a hub or knot of everything, is the tangled place where unseen work happens. Jung claims that the “cube of grey rock” refers to the philosophers’ stone, the alchemists’ Holy Grail and path to immortality or at least rejuvenation. In his reading, the tree hides the philosophers’ stone in its roots. The tree—and, more specifically, its secret repository of knowledge and life called the root—contains within it everything the human might need.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">European philosophical and critical thought from the twentieth century abounds with botanical metaphors: Sartre’s nausea-inducing root, Bataille’s language of flowers, Paulhan’s flowers of Tarbes, Derrida’s <i class="calibre1">dissémination</i>, Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome, Cixous’s pollen-gagged mouths, Irigaray’s efflorescence, and Buber’s tree of contemplation are just a few representative examples. Jean-Pierre Cléro has shown how the tree has been used extensively throughout the history of Western philosophy as a metaphor for reason.<a id="fn29r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn29">26</a> Robert Dumas, in his book <i class="calibre1">Treaty of the Tree: An Essay on a Western Philosophy</i> (<i class="calibre1">Le traité de l’arbre: Essai d’une philosophie occidentale</i>, 2002), argues that the tree is a central, organizing figure for Western philosophy as a whole.<a id="fn30r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn30">27</a> His many compelling examples include Saussure’s use of the Latin <i class="calibre1">arbor</i> to illustrate <a id="p27" class="page1"></a>the differences between signifier, signified, and referent; the persistent use of the tree graph to organize knowledge; and the speculative botany practiced by many of the most famous philosophers in the Western canon and its influence on their thinking in other disciplines. Elaine P. Miller, in her book <i class="calibre1">The Vegetative Soul: From Philosophy of Nature to Subjectivity in the Feminine</i>, shows the extent of German philosophy’s reliance on plants as figures for thought and analyzes the implications of the tendency to gender the botanical as feminine and to “botanize” the female, with special focus on this theme in the writing of Kant, Goethe, Hölderlin, Hegel, Nietzsche, and others.<a id="fn31r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn31">28</a> Michael Marder has published a catalog of various philosophers’ uses of plants in his book <i class="calibre1">The Philosopher’s Plant: An Intellectual Herbarium</i>, which dedicates particularly interesting chapters to Aristotle’s wheat, Augustine’s pears, Avicenna’s celery, and Leibniz’s blades of grass. These are just a few cases of the recent interest in the relationship between the realms of philosophy and botany, but this small sampling indicates how these fields are intertwined in often unexpected and fruitful ways throughout the twentieth century. More specifically, the root, not just the plant, has a lengthy and conspicuous history in European philosophical thought. French philosophy embraced the root as a noetic metaphor—a metaphor for consciousness, the mind, and ways of knowing—at least as early as the seventeenth century, when Descartes wrote in his <i class="calibre1">Principles of Philosophy</i> (1647) that metaphysics was the root of the Tree of Philosophy. In the twentieth century, Heidegger challenged Descartes’s taxonomy, offering up his own metaphorical question: Metaphysics may be the root of philosophy, but what is the soil that nourishes it? Sartre also must have had Descartes’s metaphysical root in mind when, in his <i class="calibre1">Nausea</i> (1938), the protagonist Roquentin’s existential nausea is triggered most acutely by the visible root of a chestnut tree in the Jardin public. Sartre’s novelization of the crisis of Western metaphysics participates in a general pattern in twentieth-century Europe of the dissolution of meaning, particularly after the world wars. Samuel Beckett toys with this idea as well in his <i class="calibre1">Waiting for Godot</i> (1952), in which a single tree adorns the stage, uprooted and contextless, a possible figure for the failure of Cartesian metaphysics.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><a id="p28" class="page1"></a>Jung was sensitive to the root metaphor and even used it in the title of one of his important texts on archetypes, <i class="calibre1">From the Roots of Consciousness: Studies on the Archetype</i> (<i class="calibre1">Von den Wurzeln des Bewusstseins: Studien über die Archetypus</i>).<a id="fn32r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn32">29</a> Another term for the archetype is the <i class="calibre1">Urbild</i>, or originary picture, whose prefix <i class="calibre1">Ur</i>- will be encountered over and over again throughout my analysis: <i class="calibre1">Urszene</i> (primal scene), <i class="calibre1">Ursprache</i> (original language), <i class="calibre1">Urformen</i> (original forms), <i class="calibre1">Urpflanze</i> (original plant), <i class="calibre1">Urheimat</i> (original homeland), and, in its most basic form, <i class="calibre1">Ursprung</i>, or origin. These <i class="calibre1">Ur</i>-phenomena are frequently depicted through rhizocentric metaphors. The problem with the idea of an <i class="calibre1">Ur</i>-phenomenon is that it goes back so far into prehistory—like Goethe’s imagined primeval plant from which all others derived, or like the first human utterances that were the obsession of many etymologists—that one can never be certain of its nature. The primeval instance becomes a blank root, a <i class="calibre1">radix rasa</i>, onto which almost any imagined origin can be projected. This projection, as I will show, is often politically motivated.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is essential to notice that the archetypal image of the root (or any archetypal image, for that matter) poorly reflects the wide diversity of radical forms in extrapsychical life. The reductive archetypal image of the root represents a fraction of its possible structures in the natural world, for example, in its aerating, buttressing, propping, tuberous, or stilt forms or its aquatic or aerial types. Furthermore, the tendency to describe the root—as a figure for the past—as somehow older than the rest of the tree is also misguided. Plants constantly generate new cells, but for whatever reason, the root is imagined to predate the above-ground parts of the plant. Perhaps when a plant is seen sprouting from the ground, one imagines that a significant amount of unseen groundwork had to happen beforehand to facilitate this growth. Rather than imagining that the plant has a center point situated at the soil line from which everything grows centrifugally—as Noël Pierre did through his expression “le Noeud des Choses” (the “Knot of Things”), rendered by the translator as the “Hub of Things”—one imagines that the root builds itself below and then pushes a green finger up through the surface. In the Western imagination, the root is a bifurcating, underground, and messy reflection of the branches above and it is older than these branches. Archetypal images are always essentializing schemata, as is apparent in the discrepancy between the real and the imagined root.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><a id="p29" class="page1"></a>Gaston Bachelard’s 1948 <i class="calibre1">Earth and Reveries of Repose: An Essay on Images of Interiority</i> (<i class="calibre1">La terre et les rêveries du repos: Essai sur les images de l’intimité</i>) is the most concise catalog of the root’s metaphorical and subconscious meanings. The word <i class="calibre1">intimité</i> in his title has several meanings, including “intimacy,” “privacy,” “the inner self,” and even “comfort,” and for this reason, “interiority” is perhaps the most inclusive translation that invites all of them. The book explores images that represent “rest, refuge, or rootedness”<a id="fn33r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn33">30</a> and the psyche that folds in on itself.<a id="fn34r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn34">31</a> Bachelard identifies certain images—such as the home, the cave, the womb, and the root—whose dynamic energy always tends toward rest.<a id="fn35r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn35">32</a> Emily Apter argues, “It is literature in Bachelard that mediates and tames this archaic drive, sublimating ecodesire into a phenomenology of nostalgia for <i class="calibre1">la maison natale</i>.”<a id="fn36r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn36">33</a> Through poetry and fiction, these latent, primal energies can be vented. Subterranean life, imagined as the final resting place and a return to the womb of Mother Earth, is subconsciously strived for by all people. Both humans and plants rest in beds.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In his choice to elaborate on the root image, Bachelard shows his sympathies toward phenomenology; as I show later, this philosophy relies heavily on metaphors of rootedness and groundedness, insisting that the subject must recognize her or his embeddedness in experience. Borrowing Hans Carossa’s notion of the human’s piercing view, that penetrative gaze that looks beyond what is surface to seek the underground aspects of phenomena, Bachelard argues that the will to “violate the secret of hidden things” is part and parcel of the human’s “aggressive, etymologically inspective curiosity.”<a id="fn37r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn37">34</a> He doesn’t mean introspective, in the sense of looking into the self, but inspective: looking inside of things outside the self. To the human eye, objects have depths that ask to be explored. We thus feel sympathy with the root, whose vocation it is to probe the depths; it is, like us, an <i class="calibre1">être inspecteur</i>. The subconscious is conceived as below, sometimes architectonically (the brain as a building whose deep architecture, basements, cellars, hidden rooms, or <i class="calibre1">oubliettes</i> contain undiscovered truths, skeletons not in the ground but in the closet), sometimes <a id="p30" class="page1"></a>geologically (an archaeological dig, as in Freud’s famous opening lines about Rome in <i class="calibre1">Civilization and Its Discontents</i>).<a id="fn38r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn38">35</a> Bachelard even uses both the root metaphor and the archaeology metaphor when defining Jungian archetypes.<a id="fn39r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn39">36</a> He argues that the psychologist could get a very full picture of the soul based simply on the wide range of ways the root has been rendered by the imagination. For him, the tree is an <i class="calibre1">objet intégrant</i> (unifying object), that is, an object that allows for the integration of images (299). He describes the imagination itself as arborescent. His chapter is an accumulation of ways the root has been imagined by writers and thinkers through time and across cultures, with a strong focus on Europe. One of Bachelard’s important contributions is his insistence on the problem of attachment. He links the remembered home of childhood to the crypt, the root, and other figures of depth, all of which have the power to tether.<a id="fn40r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn40">37</a> The umbilical cord is never truly severed. We will all return whence we came: the ground. The root stands as a figure for limits. It represents the ways in which history reduces our range of experience and does not let go. Imagine a balloon tied to a guardrail: it has a range of movement and is made more dynamic in the breeze, but there is a certain perimeter beyond which the balloon cannot move unless its string is severed. In many depictions of the root, the bond with home or past is the absolute constraint. More common still is an ambivalent portrayal, alternating between sympathy and antipathy toward whatever is seen to be one’s radical beginning, perceived at times as a stabilizing force and at other times as a handicap.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A final and significant subconscious association with the root is the problem of radical violence, in the form of root rot, eradication, or severing of the <a id="p31" class="page1"></a>root—all symbolically charged expressions that involve the disintegration of the tree’s integrity. But cutting off a tree from its root does not necessarily kill it. Borrowing an image from the book of Job,<a id="fn41r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn41">38</a> Toussaint Louverture used the root metaphor in 1802 as a rallying cry for the success of the Haitian Revolution, when he declared: “By overthrowing me, they have only brought down the trunk of the tree of freedom in Saint-Domingue; it will regrow because its roots are deep and many.”<a id="fn42r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn42">39</a> Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti’s first democratically elected president, later appropriated this declaration on the occasion of his own removal, in the first speech after his exile in 2004.<a id="fn43r" class="fnref" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn43">40</a> The root has the tenacity to survive its separation from the rest of the tree. When used metaphorically, this indicates a belief that the ancestors are potentially more resilient than their descendants. Such an atavistic logic suggests that even when traditions appear to have faltered, their hidden root thrives and is capable of flourishing unexpectedly. This atavism looks toward history, hoping that latent but surviving traces of a better past are still intact. The root metaphor, as we will see, is constantly evoked in situations of cultural rupture, ecological alienation, and technophobic angst. It gives voice to apprehensions about the human species as exception and, even within the species, about the inability to maintain continuity between generations or neighbors. In the coming chapters, I show the many forms radical rupture can take and the ways people respond with hope or hopelessness to this rupture using the language of roots.</p>
