      <p class="pf">Deleuze and Guattari—and Derrida as well—were responsible in part for a fascinating tendency in philosophy and critical theory today; they are, if nothing else, at least to be credited for providing a language of the posthuman. As the refusal of an anthropocentric world, there have been many attempts in recent decades to redistribute attention, care, and even rights to nonhuman and even nonliving entities. The history of the West might be described as the (often failed) attempt to apportion certain resources, privileges, and respect as evenly as possible. Remaining for the moment solely in the realm of the human, there have been hard-fought efforts over the centuries to give rights to the disenfranchised: women, racial or sexual minorities, immigrants, children, the poor, the colonized. The attempt was then extended to animals, most notably through efforts such as Peter Singer’s animal liberation movement in the mid-1970s. We are now witnesses of efforts at extending respect to plant life, to entire ecosystems, and to the environment, which has been allegorically transformed into a person named Mother Earth. For example, Michael Marder argues, “Rather <a id="p242" class="page1"></a>than sentience, it is the finitude of a living being that furnishes the ‘yardstick’ for ethical treatment,”<a id="fn528r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn528">51</a> meaning that not just plants but anything with a finite existence deserves an elevated status alongside the human. To take this tendency one step further, several recent books have given a similar attention to things that were never alive at all, such as rocks, television sets, and precious metals.<a id="fn529r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn529">52</a> What is next? A respect for what doesn’t exist? A respect for imagined or unimaginable worlds?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The attempt to break down the barrier between culture and nature, between <i class="calibre1">anthropos</i> and all that isn’t <i class="calibre1">anthropos</i>, is a signature of our time. We find it, for example, in Philippe Descola’s impressive study <i class="calibre1">Beyond Nature and Culture</i> (<i class="calibre1">Par-delà nature et culture</i>, 2005), in which he shows that this separation is characteristic of a specifically Western and relatively recent ontology. In the preface to his book, he uses an architectural metaphor—that of a house with two floors—to describe the tendency to compartmentalize culture and nature. He argues that “various bizarre beliefs are seeping down to the ground floor” and upsetting this separation. These beliefs include “fragments of Eastern philosophy, remnants of hermetic Gnosticism, or multifaceted New Age systems, none of them very serious but liable . . . to weaken the barriers that have been constructed to separate humans from nonhumans.”<a id="fn530r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn530">53</a> In this final section, we’ll see how such mysticism has recently impacted thought about rootedness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Since our focus here is the botanical world, I will limit my analysis to the new calls for vegetal democracy, even though it must be acknowledged that this is just one iteration of the tendency to move away from anthropocentrism toward a multicentered conception of the universe. Regarding plant life alone, something is happening that will, some believe, shake the foundations of philosophy and science, something Michael Marder calls the Copernican revolution of botany. Three recent books seek to redefine the relationship between human and plant. Matthew Hall’s <i class="calibre1">Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany</i> (2011), Eduardo Kohn’s <i class="calibre1">How Forests Think: Toward an Anthropology beyond the Human</i> (2013), and Michael Marder’s <i class="calibre1">Plant-Thinking: A Philosophy of Vegetal Life</i> (2013) call for a revolution of ecospheric proportions, one that involves an overhaul of the anthropocentric drive to view plants as mere <a id="p243" class="page1"></a>resources for human exploitation. The problem is that this revolution was already attempted once in the 1970s, even before the publication of Singer’s faunal call to arms, and it was received mostly as a joke or as an amusing entertainment with no real bearing on human behavior. Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, in their 1973 hit book <i class="calibre1">The Secret Life of Plants</i>, attempted to shake the foundations of anthropocentric thought by suggesting that plants not only are sentient, but that they may have a cellular consciousness that could be superior to that of humans. The authors look toward a wide variety of sources for evidence of cellular consciousness in plants: the botanical experiments of Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, Charles Darwin, Vladimir Soloukhin, and others; the spiritual or occult writings of Rudolf Steiner and Gustav Fechner, and others like Goethe, whose thought was influenced by Rosicrucianism; and research in parapsychology, biochemistry, electrophysiology, geomagnetism, and radionics. Despite the book’s enormous commercial success as a <i class="calibre1">New York Times</i> bestseller, skeptics emerged from the woodwork to critique the authors’ shoddy method and their willingness to accept occult pseudoscience and folkloric anecdotes as truth. As a reviewer named Elsa First put it, <i class="calibre1">The Secret Life of Plants</i> was “the funniest unintentionally funny book of the year.”<a id="fn531r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn531">54</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The biographies of Tompkins and Bird point toward a passion for all forms of arcane knowledge and the world of secrets. During World War II, Tompkins worked in Italy as an undercover agent for the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) and wrote many occult-themed books, with titles such as <i class="calibre1">Secrets of the Great Pyramid, The Secret Life of Nature</i>, and <i class="calibre1">The Magic of Obelisks</i>. Bird worked for the CIA in the 1950s and wrote a book called <i class="calibre1">Divining Hand: The Art of Searching for Water, Oil, Minerals, and Other Natural Resources or Anything Lost, Missing, or Badly Needed</i>. They coauthored other books that confirmed their infatuation with the underground—in its literal and its figurative sense—including <i class="calibre1">Secrets of the Soil</i> and “<i class="calibre1">Pre-historic Science: Ancient Maps Prove Existence of Advanced Scientific Civilization Four Thousand Years before Christ</i>,” which was left as an unpublished manuscript. The subterranean in all its forms was their obsession. As I have shown throughout this study, the belief in a metaphysical connection between plants and humans is often characterized by an underlying attraction to paganism, to mystery, and to arcane and primordial knowledge. Tompkins and Bird are no exception; they reframe this tendency for an American mass audience. As we have seen, Plato described <a id="p244" class="page1"></a>the human as a plant whose soul was a root embedded in the ether. Aristotle claimed that plants possessed a vegetative soul, also shared by animals and humans, a notion taken up by the Thomists in the Middle Ages. Published in 1848, Gustav Theodor Fechner’s book <i class="calibre1">Nanna, or the Soul-Life of Plants</i> made the case for the existence of a vital psychic force in the botanical world. Fechner, who accidentally blinded himself during a series of experiments that involved staring directly into the sun, claimed he could see the souls of flowers after recovering his vision. Heidegger argued in the first half of the twentieth century that humans are grounded in their native soil and that just as the soil imparts certain defining characteristics to the flora of a particular region, the human is also marked by its place of origin. The French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas considered Heidegger’s obsession with rootedness as a kind of residual paganism, a childish tendency to view the natural world through the lens of mysticism. This begs the question: Why do humans so readily identify with plants? Why do we believe in rootedness? And why are these beliefs so consistently bound up in mystical tropes of buried origins and lost primordial connections?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There have been several other recent notable attempts to reshape our perceptions of plants. Daniel Chamovitz has written a book about what plants know and argues that they do indeed have senses. After an experiment involving plants’ response to light, Chamovitz discovered in plants and humans a shared group of genes for determining brightness, a discovery that “led to the obvious question as to what these seemingly ‘plant-specific’ genes do in people.”<a id="fn532r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn532">55</a> He is careful to distance himself from Tompkins and Bird, writing, “Worse than leading the unwary reader astray, <i class="calibre1">The Secret Life of Plants</i> led to scientific fallout that stymied important research on plant behavior as scientists became wary of any studies that hinted at parallels between animal senses and plant senses” (5). Michael Pollan has suggested, in contrast to narratives of the human exploitation of plants, that the plants have managed to engineer human desire to work in favor of their proliferation. Using as examples the apple, the tulip, cannabis, and the potato, he shows how little difference there is between the oblivious bee, carrying pollen from flower to flower in the service of its reproduction, and the human, who obeys the plant’s will by killing off some species so that others may thrive, unaware that it is in some sense the successful species’ hitman. His thesis is that “human desires form a part of natural history in the same way the hummingbird’s love of red does, or the <a id="p245" class="page1"></a>ant’s taste for the aphid’s honeydew.”<a id="fn533r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn533">56</a> For him, humans are less like plants and more like bees.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the new articulations of plant consciousness, especially Marder’s and Kohn’s, mysticism seems at first to be replaced by a poststructuralist logic. The books of Hall, Marder, and Kohn question the self-placement of the human at the center of all things and propose instead a new anthropology that gives plants an elevated moral standing. These studies go beyond the claims of animal-rights activists that human supremacy over the animal world is unjust; the same argument is now extended to the botanical realm. These thinkers use the long history of the analogy between plant and human as evidence of an anthropobotanic symbiosis that could hold the key for the human negotiation of coming centuries of environmental threats, political and territorial disputes, lack of resources, and other predicaments that impact both human and plant habitats. These studies argue essentially that the way humans behave and think cannot be separated from a primordial botanical heritage that our species would rather forget.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Matthew Hall’s <i class="calibre1">Plants as Persons</i> claims that the nature-culture divide is the cause of many of our misunderstandings about the nonhuman world. He argues that “our general, Western, view of plants as passive resources certainly plays a significant role in our ecological plight.”<a id="fn534r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn534">57</a> At the time of publication, Hall was a research scientist at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh, where he used his findings to make the case for a new conception of plants as organic beings with agency. A failure to address the needs of the plant world will ultimately imperil humans, he concludes. While people tend to think empathically about animals in certain contexts, plants remain too alien to our species for this connection to occur. The plant cannot look back at us, which gives us the impression that we are alone when facing it. The objective of Hall’s book is to find “the most appropriate behavior toward plants in a time of impending ecological collapse” (4). To this end, he challenges the cultural and philosophical biases passed from one generation to the next that force us to see the botanical world through a repressive lens. Campaigning against anthropocentrism, zoocentrism, and dualistic thinking, Hall seeks to reverse human ignorance about plants.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Eduardo Kohn’s <i class="calibre1">How Forests Think</i> broaches the same questions but from the perspective of anthropology. The book, clearly influenced by poststructuralist thought, insists on a defamiliarization of the human toward itself. <a id="p246" class="page1"></a>His project seeks to undo “anthropocentric narcissism”<a id="fn535r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn535">58</a> and replace it with a more decentered conception of the human-nonhuman connection. Using his extensive fieldwork experience in Ecuador among the people of Ávila, who—in his depiction—share a symbiotic relationship with the forest they inhabit, Kohn illustrates how the forest and the creatures that live there are composed of mutually readable signs. He advocates a new literacy that would allow the human to read nature’s signs in a profoundly different way and that would acknowledge that we are being read as well. The spirit of Kohn’s book is reminiscent of <i class="calibre1">I and Thou</i> (1923), written by the Austrian-born Israeli philosopher Martin Buber. In one passage, Buber describes the experience of contemplating a tree: “It can also happen, if will and grace are joined, that as I contemplate the tree I am drawn into a relation, and the tree ceases to be an It. . . . The tree is no impression, no play of my imagination, no aspect of a mood; it confronts me bodily and has to deal with me as I must deal with it—only differently.”<a id="fn536r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn536">59</a> In contrast to Francis Ponge, who struggled as he tried to engage presence-to-presence with a mimosa tree,<a id="fn537r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn537">60</a> Kohn argues that the human’s conceptual capacity to think beyond itself is both a gift and a responsibility; the fact that we can think outside our species and outside our moment into the past and the future guarantees us a unique and significant role as stewards in the service of those beings that surround us. While his work widens its focus beyond the plant to the forest (or any ecosystem) as a whole, he uses the same mystically infused language, writing of afterlives, the dreamworld, and soul blindness. Kohn laments the “disenchantment of the world,” Weber’s famous formulation, arguing that our mechanistic conception has led us toward an ever more meaningless world.<a id="fn538r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn538">61</a> As I will show, this claim is a signature of the contemporary poststructuralist (and the postpoststructuralist) mind-set, as evident in Marder’s work as in Kohn’s.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The most fascinating of the three, Marder’s <i class="calibre1">Plant-Thinking</i>, is approached primarily through philosophy, with special reliance on hermeneutic phenomenology, deconstruction, feminist and non-Western thought, and Gianni <a id="p247" class="page1"></a>Vattimo’s notion of “weak thought.”<a id="fn539r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn539">62</a> Dismissing Matthew Hall’s consideration of plants as persons,<a id="fn540r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn540">63</a> Marder believes that twentieth- and twenty-first-century Continental philosophy, specifically what he calls postmetaphysical philosophy, could be the most likely site of a total transfiguration of our thinking about the botanical world. He takes as his task “to give a new prominence to vegetal life” and “to scrutinize the uncritical assumptions on the basis of which this life has been hitherto explained.” The book is organized around these central questions: “How is it possible for us to encounter plants? And how can we maintain and nurture, without fetishizing it, their otherness in the course of this encounter?” (3). His book proliferates outward into a full-on critique of Western metaphysics; he sees plants as the encroaching biomass that can grow over the ruins of this kind of thinking. Regarding rootedness specifically, Marder makes a fascinating argument, one that I will cite at length to show the strange endpoint of a loop I’ve attempted to trace throughout this project:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">[The plant’s spatial rootedness in the soil is] a feature responsible for its coding as the figure of unfreedom. Tragically, occidental thought conflates the most plastic form of existence with the most rigid; not only does this view disregard the ontic exuberance and uncontrollable efflorescence of vegetal life, but it also ignores this life’s ontological potentialities, still working themselves out in various guises in animals and human beings—the variations that free it to be otherwise than it is. On the one hand, both colloquial and philosophical <a id="p248" class="page1"></a>discourses associate the rooted mode of being with immobility and captivity, but, on the other, the perceived indifference of plants interlaces their freedom with human liberty in the domains of ethics, aesthetics, and religion. Despite their undeniable embeddedness in the environment, plants embody the kind of detachment human beings dream of in their own transcendent aspiration to the other, Beauty, or divinity. (12)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">In contrast to the countless examples we’ve seen throughout this book’s pages of writers and philosophers who celebrate rootedness, Marder reads in the human’s gaze at the plant a kind of pity for its terrestrial captivity. He argues that “the intelligence of plants is not merely a shadow of human knowing, and their behavior is not a rudimentary form of human conduct.” Positing that plants are only marginal on a conceptual level, since “vegetal cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth,”<a id="fn541r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn541">64</a> Marder calls philosophy a sublimated plant-thinking and announces a long-overdue consideration of plants as beings that have much to teach us about thought, time, use of resources, the mind-body divide, and silence. If humans conceive of themselves as attached to the land, this could be owed to their vegetal intuition, just one manifestation of the botanical aspects of ourselves. The roots are the site where death is converted to living matter, leading to what Marder calls “a non-mystified and material ‘resurrection.’”<a id="fn542r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn542">65</a> The reader may note the tensions in Marder’s simultaneous celebration and refusal of a mystical logic. Throughout the book, he insists upon transcendental elements of botanical life but tries to find a demystified vocabulary to accomplish this. If, like Kohn, Marder alludes to the Weberian “disenchantment of the world,” he does so in order to set up a discourse of what he calls the “post-metaphysical ontology of vegetal life” or “plant-thinking” (18), which opens up the possibility for a new botanical mysticism emptied of God or anything resembling him. Like Monsieur Teste, <a id="p249" class="page1"></a>Valéry’s plantlike “mystic without God,”<a id="fn543r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn543">66</a> one may recognize Marder as an author who is enough of a child of the Enlightenment to reject irrational, mystical thought but who recognizes the need to give voice to the enigmatic, in-between spaces of existence that rational thought cannot attend to.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not one of the authors of these three books mentions the widely known precursor <i class="calibre1">The Secret Life of Plants</i>, perhaps in a conscious effort to distance themselves from the weird science it contains. We could perhaps call Hall, Kohn, and Marder “intellectual agnostics,” thinkers who want to dissolve dualistic thinking by refusing to accept the binaries of East and West, mysticism and rationality, and human and nonhuman. Particularly Kohn and Marder’s books rely on poststructuralist vocabulary,<a id="fn544r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn544">67</a> and I think it is fair to say that a substantial amount of Heideggerian paganism is to be found in both books. They attempt to do with anthropology and philosophy what religious thought—Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and animism, for example—has already been doing for centuries. In intellectual circles, to call someone a pagan is to accuse the person of elementary religiosity bordering on superstition. This viewpoint considers religion within a progress-oriented, evolutionary framework, implying that faiths have become more complex and sophisticated in time, perhaps even emptying themselves of the mystical element altogether and becoming pure intellect emptied of spirit. For a twentieth-century thinker to return to the bygone or subsumed tropes of a premonotheistic faith in nature is often perceived as a devolution. But one wonders whether, in the examples I’ve given of the new arguments favoring human-plant syntheses, there is not a tacit admission that paganism got many things right. Have we come full circle? Are we witnesses to a neopaganism that has found a legitimating discourse to camouflage the intellectual’s past derision of mysticism?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One could argue that these new attempts to botanize the human and to humanize the plant are simple literalizations of the pathetic fallacy, that old literary projection of human emotions onto nonhuman entities in nature that so frustrated John Ruskin. They could be the result of an ever-more-palpable, species-wide eco-guilt about our treatment of the planet; a compassionate frenzy to extend human rights to everything in sight: animals, plants, water, and rocks; or mere philosophical improvisations of thinkers who resist the <a id="p250" class="page1"></a>frameworks that confine them. Or, the botanical intuitions of these thinkers could be absolutely spot on. Whatever the case may be, the near simultaneity of their arrival indicates a sudden consciousness of this particular kind of nonhuman presence and an impulse to make sense of this awareness. Paradoxically, the fact that we are able to entertain such thoughts reaffirms our absolute difference from animals and plants, who would never be able to have such a thought. By articulating a hope that humans still have the capacity to recontextualize themselves, restoring lost ties with the natural world, we only confirm the impossibility of this task. As in Denise Levertov’s poem “Re-Rooting,” in which our attempts to “put the roots back” only show the extent of our existential awkwardness, there is nothing less plantlike than the attempt to discover something plantlike in ourselves. It would never occur to a plant to embark on such a venture. The plant is very good at simply <i class="calibre1">being</i>, something the human hasn’t been good at for millennia.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These new developments allow the rationalist, particularly the atheist or agnostic kind, to entertain the possibility of an afterlife once more. If the root is the place where what has decomposed gets siphoned up again into new life, this means its function is one of resurrection. God is not needed in this life-for-death transaction, or at least he remains behind the scenes. It is possible again to shove away death with the comforting thought that our expired bodies may be upcycled into a Douglas fir.</p>
      <p class="sec">*</p>
      <p class="pf">I have argued throughout this book that the most important developments in Continental philosophy of the twentieth-century have involved taking a position on the problem of rootedness, making it one of the most central philosophical concerns from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present. For example, psychoanalysis and the philosophical schools that borrowed from and informed it relied on the exploration of the subterranean aspects of the psyche, the dark symmetry of conscious thinking that remained below ground. Phenomenology depended on a rerooting of philosophy in subjective experience, while existentialism concerned itself with the rootedness of being. Conceptual schools of thought that took interest in the absurd described it as a cutting off of the human from the physical and metaphysical roots that at one time managed to bind people to the world. The obsession with etymological roots touched various schools of thought throughout the twentieth century, particularly among those thinkers we might call “authenticity seekers.” As <a id="p251" class="page1"></a>Ihab Hassan, Emily Apter, and others have argued regarding the shift from a modern to a postmodern sensibility, thinkers, writers, artists, and other cultural agents moved progressively away from a root-based conception of the world to a rhizomatic one. Poststructuralists like Deleuze and Guattari found the rhizome to be helpful in altering the ways we think about and organize knowledge. And the interest of ecologically oriented philosophers, such as Arne Næss and his notion of deep ecology, requires a reconceptualization of the human’s relationship with its dwelling place and a consideration of the intrinsic value of the not-human. Finally, the recent calls by thinkers such as Hall, Marder, and Kohn for a more democratic treatment of plant life continue the work begun in poststructuralist circles, which sought a more reciprocally rooted relationship between the human and the nonhuman world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What is common to all of these late negotiations of rootedness and rootlessness—Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome and nomad, Derrida’s <i class="calibre1">destinerrance</i>, Glissant’s <i class="calibre1">errance enracinée</i>, Charles’s <i class="calibre1">enracinerrance</i>, Flusser’s taking up residence in homelessness, Hall’s plants as persons, Kohn’s thinking forest, and Marder’s plant-thinking—is the synthesis of binaries and the categorical refusal to decide. In contrast to the obstinate declarations of someone like Paul Claudel or Maurice Barrès, who were certain of their roots in faith or fatherland, the new roots are just barely roots, always a hybrid of root and something else. It’s almost as if we find it impossible to let go of the idea of rootedness but we can’t come to terms with its control over us. How is one to refuse an age-old metaphor? By literalizing it? Celebrating its opposite? Changing its name? Hybridizing it? Even those who are opposed to the idea that people have roots tend to celebrate nomadism as its own kind of rootedness. The disconnectedness of the world has seeped into philosophy, which inevitably reflects the spirit of the age. It seems that a real sense of rootedness is only possible for those of a conservative bent, and even then, these loud but timorous claims to a heritage or a place are responses to the threat that this heritage or place is in the process of dissolving.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There seems to be a general intuition in Europe that culture is in decline and the appeal to rootedness is a clear symptom of it. Nature maintains a steady indifference toward cultural peaks and troughs. Perhaps the desire to become rooted in nature is the desire to sidestep the instability of culture’s fluctuations and the mercurial aspect of the human in favor of a system that, while dynamic and cyclical, seems to follow a calmer logic. The giant sequoias evoked at the beginning of this book are unconcerned with the rise and fall of democracies. Karl Jaspers, in his essay “A New Humanism,” claims that “the disintegration <a id="p252" class="page1"></a>of historic memory is the result of the anti-historic trends in modern technology and politics.”<a id="fn545r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn545">68</a> The human is essentially at war with its own memory, which it seeks to eradicate. Maybe this is how people want to become more like nature: by nullifying memory, that faculty that distinguishes us from the rest of the living world. Perhaps the human has discovered that memory is too big a burden, that it makes us behave in destructive ways and contributes to our self-extermination. But Jaspers believes that only through memory can the human achieve its full potential. He asks: “Can man break with history? Can he sever his own roots? Can he unfold out of a historic void, and can his mere biologic nature enable him to realize a humanity based on nothing but this biology, this nature, this instant, and seeing and seeking nothing beyond an imaginary charismatic future? No. Man must know what he was, to realize what he can be” (81). Instead of cultivating ties with history, it seems that we’ve accepted our fate of rootlessness and made the decision not to suffer it alone: instead, we’ve opted to uproot the whole world along with us, to give ourselves company in this state of uprootedness. The German poet and doctor Gottfried Benn found it difficult to imagine “a God who created anything as gentle as plantsand trees” when considering the technological developments of his age: “electronic brains, artificial insemination for cows and women, chicken farms with music laid on to increase productivity, artificial doubling of the chromosomes bringing about giant hybrids, deep freezing, over-heating.”<a id="fn546r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn546">69</a> Developers of these technologies—meant to make life easier, to smooth time and space, and to open up new possibilities—have forgotten to take something essential into account: namely, those long-term effects that permanently restructure the way the human participates in the world. As specialists, they are trained as microrather than macroscopic thinkers, which means they think in terms of parts over wholes. To specialize is to decontextualize. This specialization is the response to a simple fact: The world and what is knowable have become too big for the brain to handle. We favor a more manageable smallness over unwieldy largeness and thus break civilization down into its composites. This cultural contraction has led us to think inwardly, to fold in on ourselves, to celebrate imagined microcommunities, to atomize knowledge, and to move from the big to the small picture. A narcissist is a specialist of the self. We have asked for a compacting force to process the immensity of culture into bite-sized pieces, to summarize and synthesize significant events to save us the time of thinking through them holistically. But by doing so, by caring only about what is immediate<a id="p253" class="page1"></a> and summarizable, we forfeit our own context. If we continue to insist on the root metaphor, it is merely a utopian projection of a more integrated life that seems for the moment unattainable. It could be a matricial memory, similar to the one that draws us to the shores of oceans whence we crawled. We have been out of context for a very long time. The metaphor follows us around to remind us.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Why do some subfields of philosophy and linguistics insist on the importance of context? It is because without it, meaning breaks down. Recall that this is the definition Julia Kristeva gave to abjection, namely the site where meaning breaks down when the separation between subject and object begins to deteriorate. In my reflections on rootedness, a constellation of terms kept appearing: decontextualization, breakdown of meaning, increased abstraction, alienation. It was Simone Weil’s writing that nudged me toward a significant conclusion: When people seek roots, they are refusing death’s abstraction. The root, in its constant proximity to death, possesses a more than concrete molecular understanding of the process of death’s conversion into life. To have roots is to facilitate continuity, to embody the cyclical processes of the natural world, and to disregard the abstract qualities of death by simply making new life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In recent years, the Swedish company Promessa Organic Burial has developed a method called “promession” for turning a human corpse into compost that can feed a memorial tree or bush above the buried body. After the cadaver is freeze-dried and pulverized, it is buried in a coffin made of corn starch, which decomposes naturally without polluting the surrounding soil. The deceased may opt to have a tree or bush planted above the burial site and fed by his or her body. Like Ovid’s tale of the mulberry tree that changed from white to red as the blood of the lovers Pyramus and Thisbe fed its roots and leaves, promession allows the human body to surrender its life essence to another entity that will make good, visible use of it. This accelerated “vegetal afterlife,”<a id="fn547r" class="fnref" href="part0014_split_004.html#fn547">70</a> as Marder would call it, involves the conversion of dead cells into living ones through the root’s transformative proficiency. The body, entrusted to Mother Nature, is guaranteed to live again, a promise that God, in the eyes of skeptics, cannot keep. Another justification for promession is its ethical soundness as an environmentally responsible way to inhume the human. If one cannot treat the environment with care in life, at least a full surrender to it in death—through giving the self over willingly to its decompositional processes—feels like a small compensation. If there is something appealing about this fusion <a id="p254" class="page1"></a>with nature, it is that such a fusion has become virtually impossible in life. In our mortal awkwardness, we are, it seems, incapable of staying in context. As we leave the rhizosphere behind, harboring a deep nostalgia for it, there is consolation to be found in the fact that it is possible in death to be enfolded in the very constitution of the root.</p>
