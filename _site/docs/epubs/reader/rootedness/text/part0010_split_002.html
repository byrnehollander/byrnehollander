      <p class="pf">The tree and its associations with life and knowledge provide a unifying thread between the Old Testament and the New Testament. This thread and, more specifically, the notion of the root, fascinated the French writer and devout Catholic Paul Claudel (1868–1955), who used biblical imagery and various biblical tableaux (the scene of the Garden of Eden, the Nativity, the Crucifixion) as hermeneutically decipherable images for understanding the Christian mystery. His vision is significant in that he provided one of the most resounding poetic voices of French Catholicism in the literary and theological history of the nation. He was elected as an <i class="calibre1">immortel</i> to the Académie française in 1946 just after World War II, thus validating him as the literary father of the neo-Catholic movement in postwar France. Claudel’s religious fervency was the kind that takes everything as a sign of God’s work and as an invitation to multiply symbols and intertwine them. I would not argue that he is characteristically Catholic or characteristically French in his particular fashioning of the root metaphor; rather, I show that his hyperbolic exploration of it shows how far a devotional metaphor can be pushed. More an exception than a rule, Claudel attempts to test the most extreme possibilities of using metaphor as a tool of conversion. His compulsive generation of images borders on the baroque, <a id="p85" class="page1"></a>imitative of the relentless proliferation of some plant species. It may seem an odd comparison, but the multiplication of synonymous images—synonymous in that they communicate the same thesis—resembles the proliferation of images in Deleuze and Guattari’s <i class="calibre1">Anti-Oedipus</i> and <i class="calibre1">A Thousand Plateaus</i>. These three writers allow one metaphor to bleed into the next in their maximalist prose and let the pictures do the talking. As I show in <a class="page1" href="part0014_split_000.html#ch07">chapter 7</a>, the authors also shared a mystical vision of the plant.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In Claudel’s entire exegetical corpus, but particularly in <i class="calibre1">A Poet before the Cross</i>, he appropriates specific biblical events and their symbolic content as diachronic scenes in which the past, present, and future are simultaneously accessible. He takes as his writerly objective the reading of what I will call cryptographic tableaux. In these passages, word, image, and symbol combine to create a singular, decodable unit, all elements of which merge into one readable sign, a meaningful whole that short-circuits time and space. The move Claudel attempts to make in his biblical exegesis is comparable to the etymological obsessions by thinkers such as Martin Heidegger, fueled by the belief that if the origins—of signs, of words, of symbols—could be traced, the mystery, of language and of life, could be deciphered.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Much of Claudel’s interpretive performance has to do with negotiating the tensions between the low and the high, in other words the poles of the vertical scale essential to the argument of this chapter. Claudel was particularly sensitive to the root metaphor and its connection to transcendence. In the work of many writers, the root is a superficial metaphor for talking about origins. However, in Claudel’s work, the root is not only a necessary component of his most significant cryptographic tableaux; it is a key figure for understanding one’s relationship to God, Christ, and all that is holy. For him, rootedness of humanity in original sin is both literal and figurative: the roots of the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden, a real tree that actually existed, contained within them the fall and redemption of humanity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Claudel follows a <i class="calibre1">topos</i> that developed during the medieval period, in which the True Cross on which Jesus was crucified was made from the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden.<a id="fn161r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn161">16</a> In his <i class="calibre1">A Poet before the Cross</i>, Claudel makes a series <a id="p86" class="page1"></a>of cognitive leaps between various symbolically charged Christian images. He writes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">What else is the serpent save a simplified diagram, the breath in a sheath, the root of the soul in the flesh, the humiliated spirit grovelling on the ground, the spirit which incessantly schemes against the heel of our mortality and keeps us from subsisting? What form was more suitable to the Word in His final abasement when for us he bore sin and mire. <i class="calibre1">But I, poor worm, have no manhood left</i> (Ps. 21:7). It pleased God to pick that up and give him a <i class="calibre1">name which is greater than any other name</i> (Phili. 2:9), so that we should see interwoven on the cross in the same calligraphy the root of our fault and the root of our salvation. This is the Tree which for our wonder produced the <i class="calibre1">Kingdom of God</i>, the <i class="calibre1">seed</i> which the Gospel speaks of, so small that it is the smallest of all and cannot be perceived by our senses. It has now become this tremendous tree.<a id="fn162r" class="fnref1" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn162">17</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">Three concepts here emphasize the centrality of the Word to Christian dogma, each with a specific role: <i class="calibre1">Verbe</i> (the Word)<i class="calibre1">, Evangile</i> (the Gospel) and <i class="calibre1">calligramme</i>, rendered by the translator here as “calligraphy.” <i class="calibre1">Le Verbe</i>, or God’s word, which creates as it is uttered, binds creation and speech. It is not yet fixed in time by book or writing. The Word does not tell things; it makes them. The <i class="calibre1">Evangile</i>, the Gospel or Holy Book, is a record of events written by man. <a id="p87" class="page1"></a>This written word does not create; it is merely mimetic. It reproduces in written language what were supposedly the foundational moments of the Christian faith. The tellers are men, not God. The <i class="calibre1">calligramme</i> transforms the various tableaux of the written account into deeply charged, readable units, or sign clusters that accumulate and mean more than their discrete parts. Claudel would have been familiar with the notion of <i class="calibre1">calligramme</i>, typically composed of text whose distribution on the page contributes to the meaning of the words themselves, which had been explored by Apollinaire in his 1918 publication <i class="calibre1">Calligrammes</i>. Apollinaire, who coined the term, described <i class="calibre1">calligrammes</i> as “an idealisation of free verse poetry and typographical precision,”<a id="fn163r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn163">18</a> as they are often arranged in representational forms (the shape of a face, the form of falling rain). However, Claudel transforms the calligram into a configuration in which the words eventually fall away, leaving only clusters of symbolic signs that merge to make one relevant unit. Claudel qualifies the cross and its configuration as a calligram that shows humanity both “the root of our fault and the root of our salvation.” Here, the Tree of Knowledge rather than the Tree of Life provides the wood from which Christ’s crucifix is built. This remarkable image, which mimics the earlier medieval depiction described above, contributes several new elements to the <i class="calibre1">topos</i>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First, the notion of snake and root are conflated in Claudel’s passage, a fusion that later interested Bachelard in his <i class="calibre1">La terre et les rêveries du repos</i>.<a id="fn164r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn164">19</a> Claudel’s description of the serpent as a simplified diagram, pattern, or blueprint (“une espèce de schéma simplifié”)<a id="fn165r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn165">20</a> is a figure for the <i class="calibre1">calligramme</i>-like tableaux that populate his oeuvre. The <i class="calibre1">schéma</i> involves a single decipherable unit that summarizes or encapsulates the entirety of a given message. Like fractals, a geometric pattern whose parts have the same statistical pattern as the whole, the single snake encapsulates in its form the entire story of Christ’s abasement and renewal. The snake and the root share an abject nature, but in Claudel’s telling, they are both mere beginnings of a story of exaltation. Real roots are nefarious to the human in that they have the power to bore through <a id="p88" class="page1"></a>man-made structures such as walls and foundations. The twisting fibers of the root drill their way through cement and stone simply to reach a water source. The Romantic obsession with ruins points toward this capacity of the botanical to overrun and erase the architectural remnants of civilization. The root here is indeed a figure for the fall of man, albeit rectifiable. But the snake and the root are images not only for endings but for beginnings as well. The snake engenders man’s life as a mortal being. Given that the word <i class="calibre1">sémence</i> appears shortly after the snake imagery and that Claudel’s exegesis moves vertically from down to up, the phallus is clearly connoted, with the tree beginning as “the smallest seed” and swelling eventually to immense proportions. <i class="calibre1">Sémence</i>, the stuff of biologic origin, is also a metaphor for beginnings. Another hint at the connection between the snake and the male sex organ is the reference to Psalms 21:7: “<i class="calibre1">But I, poor worm, have no manhood left</i>.” The worm, the diminutive of the snake, depicts the lesser man whose member is shriveled and impotent. However, this sexualization of the snake as a base figure for the lowliness of the body is only half of the story; the other half is one of ascension and triumph over the body. Of the serpent, Claudel writes, “Thus everything, even the Serpent himself, that living insidious root entwined on all cordages and all the vessels of our soul and our anatomy, the lowest, eating dust for food, is exalted as on the end of a pike, within the divine plan” (143). In Claudel’s vision, the low and the high are intimately bound; the snake and his lowly origins are transfigured and elevated, following a recurrent pattern he identifies in the Gospel, visible in Christ’s humiliation and subsequent glory.<a id="fn166r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn166">21</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Claudel also revives an important connection between roots and stars, inspired directly from Revelation 22:16: “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”<a id="fn167r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn167">22</a> Claudel makes a point of emphasizing this portion of the quote in the footnote: “<i class="calibre1">Ego sum radix</i>” (299n1). He goes on to explain: “The body was formerly here below what transforms the spirit into a face, but now the spirit is that which transforms the body through the face and above the face into a light, and through this effect, enveloped with rays and directions, it becomes breathable and intelligible to everything that surrounds it. Such is the meaning of the passage in the Apocalypse in which God promises to give the faithful star <a id="p89" class="page1"></a>of the morning. For He Himself is in her the <i class="calibre1">root, the splendid morning star</i> from which emanates in all directions a life-giving ray” (162). The highness of the star that signaled Jesus’s birth is mirrored by the low root of provenance. The nativity scene provides a tableau that juxtaposes lowness (in the form of the humble conditions of birth, among animals and in a manger) and highness (in the form of the star and the three highnesses, the Magi, who come to pay homage to the newborn). Claudel sees in the cross a configuration in which all opposites converge and resolve themselves. Using the cardinal points to illustrate the reconciliation between opposites, Claudel gestures toward the etymological root of the word “cardinal,” a word used for geographic direction and for the Church’s dignitaries. The root of the word “cardinal” is “cardo,” meaning “door hinge.” Thus that which is cardinal is that upon which everything else hinges: “The cross is God at work. It is not only His instrument, it is His active form, His extracting unifying operation, His extension between the four cardinal points: the north or zenith which is the root in the <i class="calibre1">firmament</i>; the south or nadir which is matter warmed by grace on which force is exerted; the arms to the right and the left are the instruments of His temporal energy” (228). Claudel recalls here the Platonic notion of the root in the firmament. The north, the direction most associated with guidance, is here not merely that which lies in the direction of the North Pole but rather that which points toward the heavens, which lead the human in times of disorientation. The south here is not a cartographic south; rather, it is downward into the bowels of the earth, where the weight of gravity and earthly burdens press toward the ground. The right and left arms of Christ on the cross are “instruments of His temporal energy.” The reference to time, a man-made notion or at least a phenomenon made measurable by man, could here refer to the horizontal, ordinal continuum of history, which Christ enfolds wholly and without reserve, reaching to the left and to the right along the human plane as an embrace of humanity through time. He exists beyond the life span of his physical body to express his love toward humankind from its inception and beyond his own bodily death. Christ’s sign of love is an openness to and embracing of the whole of the human race. As Claudel puts it, “Everything on the cross is consummated, not in the constitution of an inert figure, but in desire, in cooperation and in a uniting organic activity. What was broken is restored” (142). Again, the rooted cross is the singular figure in which the Fall and Redemption crystallize.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Claudel reinforces the connection between Adam and Jesus with the unifying theme of wood:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Concerning wood, under which we see the Son of Man appear tottering and crushed—and which three times got the better of Him—so many writers, more <a id="p90" class="page1"></a>learned than I am, have written, that there is little left for me to say. Adam ate the tree with the apple and now he is one with this robe of wood which associates him to the root of each of its fibers, physical and spiritual, to the knot of its joints, to the travail of birth and death agony, to the accomplishment of its vegetable purpose. The wood, this rough cross which had not yet achieved perfect form, is everything to which God has under the circumstances entrusted the task of making man again in His image, everything which in this ambiency is born to exercise on him an action, a formative constraint. It is the framework and the director. It is the instrument of the painful harmonization in ourselves of the inner with the outer.<a id="fn168r" class="fnref1" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn168">23</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">This passage emphasizes the corporeal rootedness of the Fall and the Redemption, not only in Adam but implicitly in every living human, as offspring of the first man. By stressing that the root is a physical and spiritual one, Claudel attempts to make his argument both literally and figuratively, or rather, both physically and metaphysically. The wood draws Adam in to each of its fibers and to the knots of its joints, biologic components that belong to both human and plant, thus reinforcing the image of man as botanical being. Another obvious connection implied in this excursus on wood is the vocation of Jesus’s earthly father, Joseph, that of carpentry. In the Christian imagination, Jesus was witness as a child to the constructing and artisanal crafting of wooden structures. His life expired on a structure built of the same material. Claudel chooses the word “armature,” translated here as “framework,” to describe the wood’s function as the infrastructure for the Fall and Redemption of humanity. Claudel’s unusual expression “devoir végétatif,” insufficiently rendered in English as “vegetable purpose,” invests the tree itself with agency and motive, thus personifying it. Perhaps Claudel attempts here to Christianize Aristotle’s notion of the vegetative soul, that intrinsic force in the plant that is responsible for its growth and reproduction.<a id="fn169r" class="fnref" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn169">24</a> In his recasting of the term, he invests the tree with the ability not only to preserve and proliferate its own life, but to proliferate Life, <i class="calibre1">all Life</i>, through Christ. The tree’s duty, from its rootedness in the Garden of Eden to its apotheosis as the cross, is one with its very materiality, <a id="p91" class="page1"></a>and its message insinuates itself into the <i class="calibre1">dramatis personae</i> of the Christian chronicle. The tree provides the material out of which the Christian mystery is built.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In an odd footnote in this section, Claudel writes that he read the following passage “somewhere” (“lu quelque part”), without specifying the source:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">For the cross was not made of ordinary wood. A branch was first broken off from the tree of good and evil, then planted on the grave of the first man. This branch developed, grew with such magnificence that no tree could be compared with it. That was the predestined wood, the mysterious imperishable trunk. It was one of its branches which Noah’s dove brought to the ark. Another, later on, furnished Moses with the staff with which he struck the rock. It furnished the bridge over the torrent proposed by Solomon to the Queen of Sheba and on which, through respect, she refused to set her foot when she entered Jerusalem. It was then miraculously preserved in the depths of the pool in Jerusalem until the moment of the Passion.<a id="fn170r" class="fnref1" href="part0010_split_007.html#fn170">25</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">It is remarkable that Claudel cites the passage with precision but without recalling its source. We find in this excerpt a condensed and finely articulated synopsis of the tree’s trajectory from its roots in the Garden to its new form as crucifix. Claudel was certainly not the first to propose this connection between the fall of humanity and its redemption. One could say, in fact, that Claudel’s assertions are consonant with Catholic dogma, reinforcing the inner logic of God’s string of mysteries and the metaphysical connectedness of each biblical episode. The instability of Europe in Claudel’s time was the source of a renewed spirituality in France, when neo-Catholicism found a weakened populace amenable to its message. During this interwar period after the Great War, in which France lost more lives than in World War II, it is clear that Claudel attempts to find meaning in the universe, to reroot the human in some sense of purpose. He was not the only one to turn to the metaphor of rootedness as a path to transcendence and a possible solution to Europe’s disorientation in the first half of the century. As we will see in <a class="page1" href="part0011_split_000.html#ch04">chapter 4</a>, Simone Weil also found this metaphor useful in thinking about ways to restore Europe’s former greatness after World War II, as did Martin Heidegger, who proposed a new kind of groundedness as the solution to humanity’s distress in coping with new technologies in the atomic age.</p>
