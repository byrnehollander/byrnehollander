      <p class="pf">Bachelard valued in particular the poetry of Francis Ponge (1899–1998), who showed his readers that “by working oneirically at the interior of things, we go to the dreaming root of words.”<a id="fn55r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn55">2</a> Ponge’s poetry is perhaps the most botanically oriented in the twentieth-century French literary canon. The language of vegetal proliferation is found throughout his corpus, particularly in his <i class="calibre1">Le parti pris des choses</i>,<a id="fn56r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn56">3</a> <i class="calibre1">La rage de l’expression, Le pré</i>, and <i class="calibre1">La fabrique du pré</i>. He notes the comparison—made frequently in literature and philosophy—between the proliferation of an idea and of a plant; he likens his thoughts <a id="p40" class="page1"></a>on a particular day to a eucalyptus.<a id="fn57r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn57">4</a> However, these ideas are headless and centerless. Michael Marder is attracted to Ponge’s vision of plantlike thinking that begins in the middle because it resists “the idealist insistence on the spirituality of the blossom and the materialist privileging of the root.”<a id="fn58r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn58">5</a> Reading Ponge through the ideas of Deleuze and Guattari, Marder considers all plant growth rhizomatic, since it begins <i class="calibre1">in medias res</i>. Ponge describes plants as “a kind of three-dimensional tapestry”<a id="fn59r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn59">6</a> and as “living crystals,”<a id="fn60r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn60">7</a> an image that calls to mind Henri Atlan’s well-known work <i class="calibre1">Le cristal et la fumée: Essai sur l’organisation du vivant</i>.<a id="fn61r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn61">8</a> Plants are living reminders of the way life can organize itself so differently from its organization in our own bodies.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Regarding rootedness, Ponge becomes extremely slippery, alternating at times between a celebration and a condemnation of radical immobility. He notes a primary difference between the animal body and the vegetal body: “Fauna moves, whereas flora unfolds before the eye.”<a id="fn62r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn62">9</a> In its false immobility—for the plant is not actually still; it creeps and spreads itself in far more creative ways than the human—the plant is seen as a passive being that unfolds <i class="calibre1">for</i> the eye, as if the human’s perception of it were its only purpose. Roots may provide stability for the plant, but they are by no means anchors, despite the tendency to metaphorize them as such. Ponge selects this common metaphor <a id="p41" class="page1"></a>in his “L’opinion changée quant aux fleurs,” transforming the plant into an anchored nautical ship:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqf">In the plant . . . this knot could be found in a certain place, between the stem and the root (not far from its exit from the earth) where growth happens <i class="calibre1">in both directions</i> (upward and downward); center or knot conserving the memory of the seed; all in all, at the center of gravity: at the base of the mast and at the top of the keel.</p>
        <p class="bql">In the spirit of this new metaphor (that of the plant-ship), one could also imagine the roots as anchors, as a system of anchors. And one could say that the plant is anchored organic material (having dropped anchor).<a id="fn63r" class="fnref1" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn63">10</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="pcon">For Ponge, the plant is ultimately a constrained entity, rooted absolutely in place.<a id="fn64r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn64">11</a> He describes plants as voiceless, paralyzed, and composed of pure <i class="calibre1">excroissance</i>, or outgrowth. In his “Faune et flore” from <i class="calibre1">Le parti pris des choses</i>, the plant is condemned to repetition, reiterating “a million times the same expression, the same leaf.”<a id="fn65r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn65">12</a> It purges “green vomit” in the form of foliage.<a id="fn66r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn66">13</a> This abject vision at first seems to indicate some intense botanophobia. Fear of the vegetal world is common in the literature of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries; as I show in <a class="page1" href="part0012_split_000.html#ch05">chapter 5</a>, Sartre’s fear of the tree makes him adopt it as a figure for the intrusiveness of Being. However, the physical abjection Ponge describes in the plant is soon replaced by a beautiful abstraction. <a id="p42" class="page1"></a>Its proliferation expresses an enthusiasm for life; as it spreads, the plant exclaims, “Excelsior! Longior!”<a id="fn67r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn67">14</a> He sees in the plant a figure for writing; in contrast, animals embody oral communication. The plant and the writer are laborers who, although immobile, glean from around them all that they need for their labor. The poet becomes emphatic, switches to all capital letters, and appeals loudly to the reader: “<span class="sm1">HENCE</span> <span class="sm1">THE</span> <span class="sm1">ESSENTIAL</span> <span class="sm1">QUALITY</span> <span class="sm1">OF</span> <span class="sm1">THIS</span> <span class="sm1">BEING,</span> <span class="sm1">FREE</span> <span class="sm1">FROM</span> <span class="sm1">ALL</span> <span class="sm1">DOMESTIC</span> <span class="sm1">AND</span> <span class="sm1">DIETARY</span> <span class="sm1">WORRIES</span> <span class="sm1">ALIKE</span> <span class="sm1">BY</span> <span class="sm1">THE</span> <span class="sm1">PRESENCE</span> <span class="sm1">OF</span> <span class="sm1">AN</span> <span class="sm1">INFINITE</span> <span class="sm1">RESOURCE</span> <span class="sm1">OF</span> <span class="sm1">FOOD</span> <span class="sm1">AROUND</span> <span class="sm1">IT</span>: <i class="calibre1">Immobility</i>.”<a id="fn68r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn68">15</a> The generalized presence of stationary plants across the planet makes all humans look like “vagabonds, homeless, with neither hearth nor home.”<a id="fn69r" class="fnref" href="part0009_split_005.html#fn69">16</a> This relativization of mobility works to undo the source of contention between the <i class="calibre1">nomades</i> and the <i class="calibre1">sédentaires</i> by positing that in relation to plant life, we are all wanderers. Rootedness makes it impossible for the plants to make mistakes, lose their bearings, or hesitate, giving them an advantage over the animal and the human. Alternating between a laudatory and a vilifying conception of rootedness, Ponge’s ambivalence participates in his standard process-oriented, essayistic writing practice, which tries out as many possibilities as conceivable. The “opinion changée” is part of his writerly method. Because of its immobility, the plant is a living object of study for the human. It cannot run from our gaze like the animal that scuttles away in the underbrush. Modeling an embeddedness in the environment that the human will never achieve until death, the plant does not go in search of the world; the world comes to it. Ponge’s lyrical rendering of this immobility oscillates between plant as imprisoned and plant as luxuriantly lodged, the most contextualized of all living entities. Ponge tries customarily to side with things, but one wonders whether he considers the plant a thing or a being. Science tends to treat it as the former, poetry the latter. Ponge’s scientifically inflected poetry tries to see it as both, sometimes simultaneously. As I show in the final pages of this book, science and poetry seem to have found a <a id="p43" class="page1"></a>new synthesis in recent theories that use science and philosophy to defend the poetic view of the plant’s ontology.</p>
