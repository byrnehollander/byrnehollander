<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In this project I aim to demystify Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s <a href="#rhizome-as-mystical-or-metaphor">rhizome</a> as described in their 1980 book <a href="" id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a>. I attempt to do so in a rather ambitious fashion–by applying their concept to this website as a whole; I treat this page as an assemblage to plug in seemingly disparate concepts. My primary goal is to provide a vision for what a hyperliteral rhizome <em>might</em> look like. D|G insist their rhizome is not a <a href="#rhizome-as-mystical-or-metaphor">metaphor</a> and simultaneously insist that any rhizome is too unstable to be represented, that “a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model” (<a href="" id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;">12</a>). I suppose this project was born from my frustration with this notion that there is no way to visualize <span class="marginnote">However, don’t feel obligated to engage with this post linearly. I hope readers find their own way through this page and its hyperlinks. In fact, here’s <a href="#bring-the-heat">where I think things really start to heat up</a>. After you could even go right to the <a href="#intertwingularity">section titled “Intertwingularity”</a> (I didn’t make this word up—-<a href="http://hyperland.com" target="_blank">the guy who coined ‘hypertext’</a> did. Unfortunately it didn’t catch on to the same degree). After that you could pop back in and finish the <a href="#introduction">introduction</a>? In fact, I think this might be the part where I take a detour to explain just what it is I’m trying to do here. One additional motivator for hyperlinks is the fact that (hopefully) this post will be read by people with a range of philosophical backgrounds; this will let people find their own entry point, let people who already understand trees skip over that, or those who are curious about deep learning can explore that topic first.</span> this “<a href="#the-rhizome-as-image-of-nomad-thought">image of thought</a>”. My impulse was to consider dynamic, algorithmically generated graphs (with GUIs) as appropriate visualizations: the diagram would be in constant flux as new information enters the system <em>and</em> can be manipulated by users (e.g., filtering out certain information, zooming, etc.) However, this seems to be a poor starting point for this paper: I haven’t motivated the problem, set the stakes, or considered what it would mean for these diagrams to supposedly represent rhizomes. For instance Gregoriou argues “The goal is not to represent the rhizome but to implant it in thought. The effect they [Deleuze and Guattari] are after is not the understanding of the rhizome but a functioning, a whole apparatus that connects disparate, linguistic and non-linguistic things” (<a href="" id="gre" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01aGd0VTI4bE5HeHM','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;">“Commencing the Rhizome”</a> 240). Thus, I step back and propose a roadmap through which I hope to get to the crux of this problem.</p>

<p>But before I do, I first provide a little guidance for navigating this page. It’s filled with hyperlinks<span id="side1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">I’m particularly proud of the <a href="#bibliography">bibliography</a> section (that is, its technical implementation)–anything that’s clickable opens a new window with the entire source document at your fingertips. A bunch of work went into this feature but I’ll spare you the technical details. I know I’m infringing copyright, but I implore you to suspend disbelief and imagine legality (and, for some, ethics) is not a concern here. I do it to prototype a digital rhizome. See <a href="#intertwingularity">intertwingularity</a></span> and you may have noticed that an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Annotate</code> button pops up anytime you highlight text. Consider them a recognition of the impossibility of creating a standalone work that explains a given concept once and for all. Plus, I want this page to be dynamic and to read people’s comments. I don’t think this instability implies any more chaos or disorganization than a typical academic paper.<span id="side2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">For instance, would willful disorganization have a <a href="#table-of-contents">table of contents</a>?</span> <span class="marginnote"><amp-img width="245" height="138" src="http://i.imgur.com/lNkeZXX.gif"></amp-img></span> Additionally, D|G are of the same mind when it comes to any totalizing project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe only in totalities that are peripheral. And if we discover such a totality alongside various separate parts, it is a whole of these particular parts but does not totalize them; it is a unity of all those particular parts but does not unify them; rather it is added to them as a new part fabricated separately.</p>
  <p class="footer">Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, <a href="" id="anx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01QkEwNFFPQ3lwZHM','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Anti-Oedipus</em></a> (42)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I would rather not paraphrase Deleuze and Guattari, this one is worth keeping in mind: <em>when the sum of the parts become a whole, the whole itself becomes a part</em>. One metaphor might be assembling an infinite puzzle: while you can connect pieces to form largest units, there will always pieces left to connect.</p>

<p>Which reminds me: while I have a <a href="#references">laundry list of references</a> and <a href="#relevant-literature">suggestions for further reading</a>, this is not a rigorous academic paper. To be plain, <em>I am playing fast and loose</em>. I’m going for breadth rather than depth. I view D|G’s rhizome as a challenge; perhaps my lack of exhaustive analysis is not a cop out, but an application of rhizomatic thought? I don’t buy it. I intend to explain myself and represent my ideas as clearly as possible (which is why I’ve chosen this format and selected so many visual aids). I would rather be ambitious and fail than limit my scope to something uninteresting and/or unimportant. Thus, I take advantages of abstractions wherever possible. If someone has already explained a concept clearer or more succinctly than I have, why reproduce it when I could merely point you in its direction? Through this lens one might argue that thinking rhizomatically (if this can be considered ‘thinking rhizomatically’) is an excuse for laziness. Maybe. But if I’ve already found what I consider to be the answer to a particular problem, why should I put it in different terms? I view myself as a compositor<span id="side3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>

It could be best to consider this project as a kind of starting point for grappling with the rhizome. In some ways I am overtly essentialist and in other ways I am possibly mistaken. I’ve considered that this might not be <em>the best way</em> to discuss the rhizome, but it does seem like a novel approach. Further, it is dynamic and I can continue to refine it–it will not cease to exist for all intents and purposes once it is turned it (though I discuss the ephemerality of the web in <a href="#this-post-as-a-rhizome">a later place</a>).</p>

      <span class="sidenote">That was longwinded. I hope some took my advice to navigate this page non-linearly.</span> As I said, this project began with a deceptively simple (or misleading) question: “What would a rhizome <em>look</em> like?” I now try to view the concepts on their own level and understand what problems the rhizome looked to solve. In other words, I try to unravel the context from which the concept sprang.</p>

<p>I <a href="#the-rhizome-as-image-of-nomad-thought">begin</a> by trying to locate the genesis of the rhizome project. I <a href="#structure">then argue</a> that it differs from the root in that it tries to be ‘anti-Structure’. I explore what it means to think rhizomatically and consider the concept’s position as either metaphor or literal map. I find a mystical quality in the definition of the rhizome. I consider in what ways the Internet is supposedly not rhizomatic and if the maps rhizomes produce have those same characteristics.</p>

<p>I briefly consider the <a href="#diagrams-meaningfully-spatialize-relationships">diagram</a>. I mainly provide examples of past diagrams and propose a basic outline for diagramming a rhizome. I mention Ted Nelson’s notion of <a href="#intertwingularity">intertwingularity</a> and his vision of a hypercontextual Internet to provide a model for how we might represent the interconnectedness of all things.</p>

<p>I continue with a brief discussion of methods for <a href="#simulating-and-classifying">collecting and classifying data</a> that can be turned into maps of rhizomes.

It is a book rife with geological and botanical metaphors, a book that seeks to explain space and relations within this space. It is a book of constant motion and instability.

Further, their rhizome “has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle (<em>milieu</em>) from which it grows and which it overspills” (<a href="" id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;">21</a>). I note that the rhizome is borrowed from botany, where it is a horizontal underground plant stem capable of producing the shoot and root systems of a new plant.

<p>Yet, it is by confronting this important problem that Deleuze understands that there is no simple answer.<span id="side1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>

<p>Perhaps the start can never be the beginning– how can we tackle the issue of presuppositions? In <a href="" id="dar" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01YVBwdWh0NXFIaWc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Difference and Repetition</em></a>, Deleuze argues that most of philosophy was founded on the notion of common sense as <em>cogitatio natura universalis</em> (good will of the thinker and good nature of thought). He calls this thinking the ‘pre-philosophical image of thought’ because it fails to question the nature of thought and being. This particular image of thought implies that “thought has an affinity with the true; it formally possesses the true and materially wants the true. It is in terms of this image that everybody knows and is presumed to know what it means to think.” This Image, according to Deleuze, “prejudges everything” and thus can be called a “dogmatic, orthodox or moral image”. In questioning the absoluteness of morality, Deleuze concludes that the conditions of a philosophy which would be without any kind of presuppositions are such: instead of being supported by the moral Image of thought, it would take as its point of departure a radical critique of this Image and the ‘postulates’ it implies. It would find its difference or its true beginning, not in an agreement with the pre-philosophical Image but in a rigorous struggle against this Image, which it would denounce as non-philosophical. As a result, it would discover its authentic repetition in a thought without Image” (131).</p>

<p><a id="structure"></a>The ultimate distinction Deleuze finds between nonphilosophy and philosophy is that true philosophy lacks a foundation from which to build– there is neither truth in human nature nor in the world. Likewise, Derrida’s trace is rejected for having a ‘Structure’– as radical as it may be, Deleuze argues it still has meaning because it traces a preexisting structure or genealogical inheritance. While Wampole claims that “the rhizome is not radically different from the root. It is still an embedded form, its pace of growth is the same, and it represents yet another instance of thinking botanically about thought” (223), she doesn’t take this idea of structure particularly seriously. To her it is simply a nonbinary, nonhierarchical epistemology. She says that its lack of structure means its “thinking takes place in the ground” (223).</p>

<p>I think the important take away is that a graph of the root is iterating towards theoretically realizable edges (i.e., connections between concepts). Still it is a meaning not stable enough to subsist off. Likewise, it is not clear that concepts of different kinds can be on the same graph. Important to understand that the rhizome first signaled a break between Deleuze and Barthes / Derrida who believed in the “process of rewriting, reweaving, and grafting of all of the fragments and missing parts in a “Total Work or Magnum Opus”<span id="side2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">Lambert, <a href="#lambert"><em>In Search of a New Image of Thought</em></a>, 52.</span>. In other words, Barthes and Derrida’s philosophies imply that we are constantly in the process of delaying a totalizing image (at least while consciousness is out there). Still, it is about the structure of the world and what we are based off.</p>

Roots</span></p>

<p>Still, D|G’s rhizome provides an ontology of relationships: everything is connected to everything else no matter how different they seem to be. I now make the trivial argument that some things can be more strongly connected than others. Take two slightly different sequences of DNA that end up expressing the same gene. They are more strongly connected (assuming that strength of connection is correlated with similarity) to each other than either sequence to any painting. Still, they are on the same graph.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to my initial question: <strong>How do you connect (i.e. create a map of) that which has no definitions between elements?</strong> I believe D|G respond: we don’t; the universe does. They tell us: “<strong>There exists a map, that much is for sure. Everything is on the map. Everything is connected.</strong>” Yet they claim we cannot manifest its structure. Before I go any further, I must motivate the notion that it deeply matters if we believe this statement. Further, the statement has different meanings depending on if we conceive of the rhizome as metaphor or literally. In the next section, I consider the implications of each position and relate them back to the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="rhizome-as-mystical-or-metaphor">Rhizome as mystical or metaphor</h2>
<p>Some critics have argued that <a href="" id="atx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01dE9Ja1F6aDRmMXc','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></a> should be recognized more for its poetics than for its philosophy: “by replacing argument with a flurry of pictures, [D|G] imagine they’ll change minds, since the human is such a visual creature. We no longer choose and commit to one picture; we accumulate and shuffle them” (Wapole 222). Wapole continues by arguing that this lack of argument implies a penchant for mysticism, which I hinted at in the previous paragraph. As a metaphor, this concept celebrates multiplicity and the dissolution of hierarchy and categories, and the horizontal proliferation of all aspects of life. These characteristics fundamentally influence how one experiences the world. I argue the rhizome that is an “image of thought” is a metaphorical rhizome. Lambert seems to agree: “Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatic experiment might be judged today as a failure, given that it was perceived as too abstract and appeared to convince no one, particularly not philosophers themselves” (60).</p>

<figure>
  <amp-img width="2000" height="1550" layout="responsive" src="/rhizomehttp://i.imgur.com/iCipIsC.jpg"></amp-img>
</figure>

<p>I now consider how metaphorical descriptions of the rhizome work. Some have argued it’s a style of thought more than anything. Wampole writes, “the rhizome’s vegetal matter does not last long enough to tell a tale and its surface is not dense enough to be inscribed with any lasting message. Any inscription on the rhizome would decompose along with it” (227). This statement relies entirely on the concept’s origin in botany– it doesn’t invoke any of the technical terminology from <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>. Importantly, it argues that previous generations of a rhizome don’t mark later ones, largely because a rhizome is single-generational. The response that ‘it’s because the rhizome surface’s isn’t dense enough’ doesn’t have much logic to it– why can’t D&amp;G’s rhizome have a dense enough surface?</p>

<p>Wampole continues by, as a tool, the rhizome can be used to mean whatever you want (here is a sample of titles of its various uses per chapter 7 footnote 2 of <a href="" id="wx" onclick="window.open('http://byrnehollander.com/epubs/rootedness/','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Rootedness</em></a> :</p>

<p>If we choose to literalize the concept of the rhizome, we must grapple with how this concept is <em>actually created</em>. D|G themselves didn’t want the rhizome to be treated as a metaphor. Gregoriou explains that the rhizome must be rescued from its “literary over-coding in a pedagogical discourse as a metaphor for excessive multiplicity and radical openness. <em>The rhizome must be made</em>” (246). I agree wholeheartedly that the rhizome must be made.</p>

<p>When you hyperliteralize the rhizome, you lose all metaphor (of a certain kind) in exchange for a different kind of abstraction. We can now think what it might take to define the structure for such a map. In <a href="" id="gap" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01ZDhEeUNOdXlqNWs','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;"><em>Protocol</em></a>, Galloway argues that one major quality that disqualifies the Internet from being a rhizome is its protocol, i.e., that parts of the networks have designed systems for connecting and interacting with each other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Networks] are material technologies, sites of variable practices, actions, and movements. This is, perhaps, stated too strongly. Yes, metaphors do materialize and corporealize, and, in some sense, metaphor is consonant with language itself. But discussions of networks—-especially in cultural theory-—have too often slipped into “vapor theory,” eliding a specific consideration of the material substrate and infrastructure with a general discussion of links, webs, and globalized connectivity.</p>

<p>The infrastructure is of the highest importance here. Once we have protocols, a true map from content to content is created.

  <p>Protocols do not perform any interpretation themselves; that is, they encapsulate information inside various wrappers, while remaining relatively indifferent to the content of information contained within.

<p><span id="side11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">I think my project really intensifies around here.</span>By positing the existence of a literal rhizome (and thus a map), D|G implicitly argue that a protocol exists for adding <em>anything</em> (“semiotic chain(s)”) to the graph and a function exists to evaluate the relationship between <em>anything</em> and <em>anything else</em>. While they insist that “[u]nlike a structure, which is defined by a set of points and positions, with binary relations between the points and biunivocal relationships between the positions, the rhizome is made only of lines: lines of segmentarity and stratification as its dimensions, and the line of flight or deterritorialization as the maximum dimension after which the multiplicity undergoes metamorphosis, changes in nature” and that “[t]hese lines, or lineaments, should not be confused with lineages of the arborescent type, which are merely localizable linkages between points and positions,” the six characteristics they use to define a rhizome do not support all of their assertions (22). They say everything is connected, though by lines and not lineages. But really, this definition of a rhizome is meaningless in my pursuit of visualizing a rhizome: they’ve already said every “rhizome pertains to a map that must be produced, constructed” (21). If every rhizome must have a corresponding graph, I will focus my energy there as graphs are an undeniably more stable concept than that of the rhizome. Graph terminology I will use from here on out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every node <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code></em> is anything that could be in a conceivable rhizome <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></em>.</li>
  <li>Every node <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code></em> is anything that could be in <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></em> and is not <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code></em> (no duplicates in the rhizome).</li>
  <li>I call an <em>edge</em> anything that links <code class="highlighter-rouge">node</code> <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code></em> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">node</code> <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code></em> in <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></em>.</li>
  <li>Edge <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">weight</code></em> refers to the strength of a connection (in <code class="highlighter-rouge">units</code> – it’s only rhizomes that are “composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion” (21)).</li>
  <li>Each edge’s <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">weight</code></em> is calculated by executing function <em>f</em> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">start</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">goal</code> nodes (“<code class="highlighter-rouge">weight_xy</code> = <em>f</em> (<em><code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code></em>, <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code></em>)”)</li>
  <li>There is also a function <em>fp</em> that calculates the <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">cost</code></em> of traversing <code class="highlighter-rouge">path</code> <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code></em> to get from <code class="highlighter-rouge">start</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">goal</code> (“<code class="highlighter-rouge">cost_xyp</code> = <em>fp</em> (<em><code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code></em>, <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code></em>, <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code></em>)”)
    <ul>
      <li>This function exists so we can cluster nodes with strong connections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All my edges are directed (i.e., the edge from <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code></em> to <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code></em> might not have the weight as the edge from <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code></em> to <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code></em>).</li>
  <li>A ‘line of flight’ is a vector or sequence of vectors that make the edge weights of a rhizome unstable</li>
</ul>

<p>While such a rhizome <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></em> must exist if we are to literalize the concept itself, we lack the protcol to create nodes and assign edge weights and path costs. Nevertheless, a protcol and algorithm must exist such that the <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></em> is constructed. Still, if there exists a map, there must exist a method to compute it. D|G might argue that various lines destabilize the map, but this map doesn’t seem particularly anti-genealogical<span id="side4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">What Deleuze and Guattari call the principles of cartography and decalcomania repeats the argument of the notion of a plane of consistency that is not amenable to any structural or generative model. BUT maps can be genealogical. In one generation, we can add, remove, or reweight vertices. Their likely argument is that because context has changed, so has the concept(s). While everything might have reprocussions on everything else (and does, according to them), that doesn’t mean they are fundamentally uncomparable between generations. If everything exists on a continuum, why can’t things merely shift rather than be destroyed? The result is still a map that doesn’t find the meaning, but creates it.</span>: we can create arbitrary timesteps and see how the map changes from step to step. Moreover, while we do not know the details of how the map is generated, the universe’s algorithm <em>always</em> returns an answer. (If the map were not computable, how could relationships between concepts exist?)</p>

<p>I now argue that protcols, functions for assigning edge weights and path costs, and analysis of the resulting diagram <em>must exist for all digital information</em>. Note that this is exactly how Galloway argues the Internet is not rhizomatic– “the Internet works too well. If the Internet were truly rhizomatic, it would resist identification. It would resist the deep, meaningful uses that people make of it everyday. The Net is not narrative-based, or time-based. But it still enthralls users, dragging them in, as television and cinema did before it. How? The answer is in the form” (64). It sounds like we do want identification (note that the internet is still a ‘nonsignifying system’) if it gives us the ability to make the network have deep, meaningful uses. And as shown above, a rhizome by its nature must be identified to exist; to reiterate, we might not be able to idenitfy it, but it has an identity.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why am I so confident that we can create a protocol for anything digital? Because everything digital shares a universal encoding in binary. If there exists an assemblage where everything on it is represented in binary, we can place them in a context where they relate to one another based on their relative position and their contents. The structure of the internet is worth considering. Currently, most of the web (this site included) is written based mainly on documents written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Using metadata tags, computers can categorize the contents of the web pages. In addition, <a href="" id="swx" onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2CC4lVHSR01ZmgwaGRleGFSWDQ','pagename','resizable,height=1000,width=500'); return false;">Semantic Web</a> solutions enable structured collections of information such that computers can conduct automated reasoning. However, as Berners-Lee et al. note in the article, artificial intelligence researchers have been trying to structure information so reasoning can be computed on it. Likewise, AI researchers have come up with methods to conduct automated reasoning.</p>

<p>And with this encoding, we can</p>

<p>simultaneously units and wholes from bits to databases</p>

<p>Thus, we must create a protocol to describe connections in a rhizome. If we fail to compare artifacts of the same medium (e.g., text, picture, video), we never stood a chance. If we manage this, we need to compare across mediums. Therefore, just one heuristic function must be responsible for connecting picture <em>x</em> to picture <em>y</em>, picture <em>y</em> to picture <em>x</em>,  If there is no underlying truth and everything is in chaos, impossible. But we can create heuristics for defining similarity. None are absolutely verifiably true, but what is this notion that everything is mystically connected and there is no total? Always moving and with no total, but we define connections. This is an idea of pagerank and using hypertext to mark relationships between html pages. But the pages themselves have concepts- how do we separate them out? Thus, we have a gradient. In continuous space, we don’t need to specify who is closest, but everything’s relationship to everything else.</p>

<p>So every rhizome is a map is a network. We just don’t know the protocol. (Yes, under this new definition of rhizome, the Internet fulfills all the qualifications. I discuss possible diagrams for the Internet below.)</p>

<p>We have the tools to generate new concepts - monkey and typewriters except their typewriters only have suggested phrases that they select at random. This is the infinite deferral of totalization. What if the goal is not to totalize what will be, but to show the current state of things? Context. Somewhat reminds me of the impossibility of proving the lack of free will through simulation because not enough atoms in the universe.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supposed to be useful, after all; how is a rhizome different from a recommendation engine; a consideration of where to go next; top-down view can be instructive (see diagram section)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No reason to not place things on a continuum in computational analysis “soft computing”</p>

This new cybernetic process will rely on our exponential increase in computational power to process and filter the massive data required to provide a real-time documentation of global activity and resulting behavioral patterns. Each element within our collective biosphere will need to be carefully tracked, interrelating multiple factors such as geologic and climatic conditions, predatory traits, and life cycles. In this complex and multidimensional data environment, the role of visualization will be key in pro- viding the capacity to recognize the emergent patterns and processes of these phenomena. Visualization will itself become organic, as it will need to adapt to simulate information from a wide spectrum of sources, ranging from micro/organic to macro/planetary states. The role of artificial intelligence will be critical in creating this new cybernetic form of resistance, revealing abnormal trends and anomalies and giving us the ability to utilize resources</p>

<p>Wampole 252 “To specialize is to decontextualize”  Specialization is in response to the simple fact that the world and what is knowable have become too big for the brain to handle. We favor a more manageable smallness over unwieldy largeness and thus break civilization down into composites. By focusing on what is immediate and summarizable, we forfeit our own context. Without context meaning breaks down</p>

<p>“what are maps for? This is simple enough to answer: to find one’s direction, to orient movement toward something. “

<p>we can emulate analog processes to any desired degree of accuracy with digital computation</p>

<p>Network-as-diagram based on the Deluzean concept of diagram; “Protocol considers networks through a “diagram,” a term borrowed from Gilles Deleuze. Protocol considers first a network as a set of nodes and edges, dots and lines. The dots may be computers (server, client, or both), human users, communities, LANs, corporations, even countries. The lines can be any practice, action, or event effectuated by the dots (downloading, emailing, connecting, encrypting, buying, logging on, port scanning). With this basic “diagram” you can do a number of things. You can connect the dots—all of them—making a totally connected, distributed network with more than one path to the destination. You can also disconnect dots, even delete dots (no paths, no destination). You can filter out which dots are connected to the network. You can create portals for the addition of future dots. You can designate which kinds of lines you want between the dots (for not all lines are equal; some diverge, flee; others converge, coalesce). In short, a network-as-diagram offers all sorts of possibilities for organization, regulation, and management.”</p>

<p>no perfect representation of thought; only models. how good will they be? I don’t know.</p>

<p><small>Each rectangle is a vector and arrows represent functions (e.g. matrix multiply). Input vectors are in red, output vectors are in blue and green vectors hold the RNN’s state (more on this soon). From left to right: <strong>(1)</strong> Vanilla mode of processing without RNN, from fixed-sized input to fixed-sized output (e.g. image classification). <strong>(2)</strong> Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words). <strong>(3)</strong> Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment). <strong>(4)</strong> Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French). <strong>(5)</strong> Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video). Notice that in every case are no pre-specified constraints on the lengths sequences because the recurrent transformation (green) is fixed and can be applied as many times as we like.</small></p>

<p>While unwieldly, “on a single page, the same sheet: lived events, historical determinations, concepts, individuals, groups, social formations.” Had to use special attribute loading protocols to get it to work.

<p>Wikipedia as web of links and protocol and degrees of separation game; knowledge and book image</p>

<p>perhaps the most interesting part is the idea of collaborative website 
- github lets you create your own wikipedia
- people can “clone” the repository and make changes
- comments through github as well
- if they don’t get approved, still have their own version equally valid as mine
- Automatically generate glossary with context, hiding all the other content on the page</p>

<p>when intertwingularity is not in the protocol, but merely an afterthought, it becomes a long after thought.</p>

<p>I imagine it as concentric circles. The sources most pertinent followed by ones still referenced but engaged with less, other things I’ve read (time and space), and (in no particular order) everything I’ve read, everything I’ve thought, everything I’ve ever interacted with and the same for them.
