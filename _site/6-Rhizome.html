<h2 id="the-rhizome">The rhizome</h2>
<p>The rhizome is in many ways similar to the fasicular root.</p>

<p>I note that D&amp;G assert that their rhizome is no metaphor.</p>

<p>Wampole 171: “to clear and consolidate ground, to lay foundations” references to D&amp;G What is Philosophy?</p>

<p>Wampole 216: “Ihab Hassan, Emily Apter, and others” have asserted that the twentieth century represents a shift from the root-based epistemology to a rhizomatic one</p>

<p>Thus, I get to the crux of my argument. The concept of the rhizome has a basis for claiming it is not metaphorical, but what do these assumptions mean? How does it really differ from a root and how can we visualize it?</p>

<p>In botany, a <strong>rhizome</strong> is a horizontal underground plant stem capable of producing the shoot and root systems of a new plant. Below is an illustration of the network structure that enables mushrooms to absorb nutrients from their environment.</p>

<p>Deleuze and Guattari begin <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> with an appeal to the rhizome as an image of thought.</p>

<p>Thus, it is here where we must start.</p>

<p>If we are to consider the notion that the “concept of the rhizome represents the literal translation of the… image of thought into modern philosophy” 
an image of thought that takes the form of a vast and intricate herbal (as Proust says)</p>

<p>it represents an externalization of the machinic dimension of Deleuze and Guattari’s philosophy, a machine that literally presents us with the following situation: Contemporary philosophy is an assemblage that presupposes a new image of thought on the plane of immanence.” <span id="side2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>

<p>is a concept to understand the image of thought. Shatter linearity - More total for being fragmented
Intention is to shatter “the linear unity of knowledge”, stating that “this time, the principal root has aborted, or its tip has been destroyed: an immediate, indefinite multiplicity of secondary roots grats unto it and undergoes aflourishing development (6). Replacing “root-cosmos” with “radicle-chaosmos” provide radical critical perspectives on recent semantic visions to be realized by means of computational ontologies, which fuel the Semantic Web vision.</p>

<p>Rhizome as a style of thought
To oversimplify, the rhizome functions through lateral proliferation rather than tree-like vertical extension.</p>

<p>Deleuze and Guattari themselves caution that “the root-tree and canal-rhizome are not two opposed models” (20).  The concept of the rhizome was set up precisely to challenge dichotomous branching; yet by placing rhizome against tree, how can we ignore the self-contradictory dualism?</p>

<p>[t]he problem of writing: in order to designate something exactly, anexact [sic] expressions are utterly unavoidable. We invoke one dualism only in order to challenge another.  We employ a dualism of models only in order to arrive at a process that challenges all models.  (20)</p>

<p>The relation of the rhizome to the tree is not one of dualism but of territorialization, but we shall return to this following a description of the six principles of the rhizome itself.</p>

<p>The six principles of the rhizome as listed by Deleuze and Guattari are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connection</li>
  <li>heterogeneity</li>
</ul>

<p>Goodchild reminds us that “these principles do not remain separate but mix with each other and proliferate” (1996: 85). In other words, we should bear in mind that they do not function in isolation, but only together as a rhizome. The rhizomatic method would ideally involve negotiating through all of these principles simultaneously so that they can proliferate in the reader’s mind; but for reasons mentioned in the Introduction, the paper version of this thesis will stay with the linear mode of explication, while the HTML version will enable a nonlinear negotiation by the reader.</p>

<p>Wampole 252 “To specialize is to decontextualize”  Specialization is in response to the simple fact that the world and what is knowable have become too big for the brain to handle. We favor a more manageable smallness over unwieldy largeness and thus break civilization down into composites. By focusing on what is immediate and summarizable, we forfeit our own context. Without context meaning breaks down</p>

<p>“What kind of image is to be deduced from thought? How can thinking be determined by the image, and where does image first acquire its power over thought—that is, to induce what is called “thinking” to occur within the subject? Following the thesis offered in chapter 1, I would argue that concept of the rhizome represents the literal translation of the Proustian image of thought into modern philosophy, an image of thought that takes the form of a vast and intricate herbal (as Proust says). More importantly, it represents an externalization of the machinic dimension of Deleuze and Guattari’s philosophy, a machine that literally presents us with the following situation: Contemporary philosophy is an assemblage that presupposes a new image of thought on the plane of immanence.”

<p>Wampole 216: “Rhizome-centered thinking, which breaks the root down and the power structures it represents into an unpredictable, undecidable abstraction, created the conditions under which the human loses its status as the universal sovereign over all other life forms”</p>

<p>Wampole 218: the rhizome seemed to be a living alternative to hierarchy, linearity, and institutionality. As a tool, can be used to mean whatever you want</p>
