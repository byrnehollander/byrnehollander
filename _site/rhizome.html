<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>To begin, I’m very interested in your mission of streamlining school enrollment. It immediately reminded me of the <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common Application</a>, and how it enabled me to apply to more colleges without having to duplicate my efforts. However, one major difference I noticed is that the Common App was spearheaded by a coalition of institutions creating the product for themselves. This made sense for them: these schools were well-funded, attracted similar applicants, and had increasingly low acceptance rates. Thus, I find your approach particularly interesting. There are about 40,000 private<span id="side1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>

Further, SchoolMint looks to be valuable in both giving students more choice and helping administrators better understand demand, and I’d love to join the team.</p>

<!-- <span class="marginnote">Also, unlike the Common App, SchoolMint seems to stand for access rather than [inflating admission metrics](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~juan/AQ/aq_georgetown.html).</span> -->

<p>I’m particularly well suited to this role for a few reasons. First, I have experience building my own web apps. I spent all summer working on an audio-based conferencing platform that allows for unlimited participants and sub-groups. And a couple months ago, I founded an annotation app called Notist to 1) create better online discussion and 2) remove users from the echo chambers of conventional social media. After defining the product, I recruited a team of six engineers, designed wireframes and mockups, and pitched it at a Dartmouth-sponsored competition. We won the competition and the full support of the <a href="http://dali.dartmouth.edu/">leadership and innovation lab</a>. My role has continued to evolve with the project; I’m now responsible for coding the front-end and designing the user experience. To help refine our development process, I read several books on product and project management and sought out the advice of professors and other student entrepreneurs<span id="side3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">This has also been a source of information I didn’t know I wanted to know, like that the author of <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> walks past a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cbqetU9.jpg">statue of himself</a> everyday on his way to work.</span>. I implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> for project management, and my team and I have enjoyed how it improves our visibility and clarifies our priorities.</p>

<p>Next, I’m skilled at getting to the crux of things and clearly articulating my perspective. While I’ve occasionally been admonished for asking too many questions, I think it’s vital to dig deep and understand underlying motivations. I really enjoy this process of analysis and am now writing a thesis exploring several notoriously cryptic novels by the Japanese author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a>. This project has further heightened my sensitivity to assumptions: rather than diagnose something as “postmodern,” I’ve decided to write my paper without the help of buzzwords. As a result, I’ve come up with a vocabulary that relies less on readily available associations and more on a careful return to the source material. I’ve found that this approach successfully brings others into my point of view, which I consider the core of communicating complex ideas. Further, a product can be expressed as an argument, as one must determine which ideas (features) are the most important and express them as concisely (intuitively) as possible.</p>

<p>I also have experience communicating with non-technical users. As the go-to IT person for my friends and family, I’ve been responsible for troubleshooting hardware and software since grade school. In this role, I’ve seen how everyone uses technology differently and the need for intuitive user experiences. When troubleshooting, I make a point to communicate what I’m doing and why. As with my thesis, I’ve found it critical to construct a mutually intelligible vocabulary that enables others to understand and challenge what I’m doing. In addition to improving the result, this transparency allows for an increased level of trust between me and those I’m helping. Moreover, I think trust between a startup and its customers is essential. While SchoolMint’s timing appears opportune with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9UCa2wfMfUMZ054emczUVhQbEE/view?usp=sharing">growing trust in cloud computing</a>, it is new and thus hasn’t had the time to maintain a long history of reliability. I recognize the importance of upholding strong customer relationships through dependability and attentive service.</p>

<p>I have more relevant experience that make me a fit for this role, but I think this gives you a good starting point. Still, I’d be more than happy to speak more about managing a radio station, leading a pre-orientation hiking trip for freshman, teaching Photoshop to my 10th grade art class, improving NBA forecasts for FiveThirtyEight, or analyzing data for what is hopefully a forthcoming paper in the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-experimental-social-psychology/"><em>Journal of Experimental Social Science</em></a>.</p>

<p>There aren’t many jobs out there for new grads aspiring to be product managers, and I feel lucky to have stumbled upon your posting. I’m enthusiastic about your mission, intensely curious, and want to have a dynamic role where I can wear many hats and deliver results. While I want to eventually start and run my own company, I’m excited by the prospect of working with you to make a difference in the educational system.</p>
